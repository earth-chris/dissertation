  abstract  = "We investigated the utility of high spectral and spatial
               resolution imagery for the automated species-level
               classification of individual tree crowns (ITCs) in a tropical
               rain forest (TRF). Laboratory spectrometer and airborne
               reflectance spectra (161 bands, 437--2434 nm) were acquired from
               seven species of emergent trees. Analyses focused on leaf-,
               pixel- and crown-scale spectra. We first described the spectral
               regions and factors that most influence spectral separability
               among species. Next, spectral-based species classification was
               performed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), maximum
               likelihood (ML) and spectral angle mapper (SAM) classifiers
               applied to combinations of bands from a stepwise-selection
               procedure. Optimal regions of the spectrum for species
               discrimination varied with scale. However, near-infrared
               (700--1327 nm) bands were consistently important regions across
               all scales. Bands in the visible region (437--700 nm) and
               shortwave infrared (1994--2435 nm) were more important at pixel
               and crown scales. Overall classification accuracy decreased from
               leaf scales measured in the laboratory to pixel and crown scales
               measured from the airborne sensor. Leaf-scale classification
               using LDA and 40 bands had 100\% overall accuracy. Pixel-scale
               spectra from sunlit regions of crowns were classified with 88\%
               overall accuracy using a ML classifier and 60 bands. The highest
               crown-scale (ITC) accuracy was 92\% with LDA and 30 bands.
               Producer's accuracies ranged from 70\% to 100\% and User's
               accuracies ranged from 81\% to 100\%. The SAM classifier
               performed poorly at all scales and spectral regions of analysis.
               ITCs were also classified using an object-based approach in
               which crown species labels were assigned according to the
               majority class of classified pixels within a crown. An overall
               accuracy of 86\% was achieved with an object-based LDA
               classifier applied to 30 bands of data. Object-based and
               crown-scale ITC classifications were significantly more accurate
               with 10 narrow-bands relative to accuracies achieved with
               simulated multispectral, broadband data. We concluded that high
               spectral and spatial resolution imagery acquired over TRF canopy

               ecological attributes by which different organisms and
               biological communities influence ecosystem services through
               their effects on underlying ecosystem processes. Here we
               synthesize concepts and empirical evidence on linkages between

               trophic levels. Most of the 247 studies reviewed considered
               plants and soil invertebrates, but quantitative trait--service
               associations have been documented for a range of organisms and
               ecosystems, illustrating the wide applicability of the trait

               Community Composition Data",
  author    = "Legendre, Pierre and Borcard, Daniel and Peres-Neto, Pedro R",
  abstract  = "Robert H. Whittaker defined beta diversity as the variation in
               species composition among sites in a geographic area. Beta
               diversity is a key concept for understanding the functioning of
               ecosystems, for the conservation of biodiversity, and for
               ecosystem management. This paper explains how hypotheses about
               the origin of beta diversity can be tested by partitioning the
               spatial variation of community composition data (presence?
               absence or abundance data) with respect to environmental
               variables and spatial base functions. We compare two statistical
               methods to accomplish that. The sum?of?squares of a community
               composition data table, which is one possible measure of beta
               diversity, is correctly partitioned by canonical ordination;
               hence, canonical partitioning produces correct estimates of the
               different portions of community composition variation. In recent
               years, several authors interested in the variation in community
               composition among sites (beta diversity) have used another
               method, variation partitioning on distance matrices (Mantel
               approach). Their results led us to compare the two partitioning
               approaches, using simulated data generated under hypotheses
               about the variation of community composition among sites. The
               theoretical developments and simulation results led to the
               following observations: (1) the variance of a community
               composition table is a measure of beta diversity. (2) The
               variance of a dissimilarity matrix among sites is not the
               variance of the community composition table nor a measure of
               beta diversity; hence, partitioning on distance matrices should
               not be used to study the variation in community composition
               among sites. (3) In all of our simulations, partitioning on
               distance matrices underestimated the amount of variation in
               community composition explained by the raw?data approach, and
               (4) the tests of significance had less power than the tests of
               canonical ordination. Hence, the proper statistical procedure
               for partitioning the spatial variation of community composition
               data among environmental and spatial components, and for testing
               hypotheses about the origin and maintenance of variation in
               community composition among sites, is canonical partitioning.
               The Mantel approach is appropriate for testing other hypotheses,
               such as the variation in beta diversity among groups of sites.
               Regression on distance matrices is also appropriate for fitting
               models to similarity decay plots.",

  abstract  = "Remote sensing represents a powerful tool to derive quantitative
               and qualitative information about ecosystem biodiversity. In
               particular, since plant species richness is a fundamental
               indicator of biodiversity at the community and regional scales,
               attempts were made to predict species richness (spatial
               heterogeneity) by means of spectral heterogeneity. The
               possibility of using spectral variance of satellite images for
               predicting species richness is known as Spectral Variation
               Hypothesis. However, when using remotely sensed data,
               researchers are limited to specific scales of investigation.
               This paper aims to investigate the effects of scale (both as
               spatial and spectral resolution) when searching for a relation
               between spectral and spatial (related to plant species richness)
               heterogeneity, by using satellite data with different spatial
               and spectral resolution. Species composition was sampled within
               square plots of 100 m2 nested in macroplots of 10,000 m2.
               Spectral heterogeneity of each macroplot was calculated using
               satellite images with different spatial and spectral resolution:
               a Quickbird multispectral image (4 bands, spatial resolution of
               3 m), an Aster multispectral image (first 9 bands used, spatial
               resolution of 15 m for bands 1 to 3 and 30 m for bands 4 to 9),
               an ortho-Landsat ETM+ multispectral image (bands 1 to 5 and band
               7 used; spatial resolution, 30 m), a resampled 60 m Landsat ETM+
               image. Quickbird image heterogeneity showed a statistically
               highly significant correlation with species richness (r=0.69)
               while coarse resolution images showed contrasting results
               (r=0.43, r=0.67, and r=0.69 considering the Aster, Landsat ETM+,
               and the resampled 60 m Landsat ETM+ images respectively). It
               should be stressed that spectral variability is scene and sensor
               dependent. Considering coarser spatial resolution images, in
               such a case even using SWIR Aster bands (i.e. the additional
               spectral information with respect to Quickbird image) such an
               image showed a very low power in catching spectral and thus
               spatial variability with respect to Landsat ETM+ imagery.
               Obviously coarser resolution data tend to have mixed pixel
               problems and hence less sensitive to spatial complexity. Thus,
               one might argue that using a finer pixel dimension should
               inevitably result in a higher level of detail. On the other
               hand, the spectral response from different land-cover features
               (and thus different species) in images with higher spectral
               resolution should exhibit higher complexity. Spectral Variation
               Hypothesis could be a basis for improving sampling designs and
               strategies for species inventory fieldwork. However, researchers
               must be aware on scale effects when measuring spectral (and thus
               spatial) heterogeneity and relating it to field data, hence
               considering the concept of scale not only related to a spatial
               framework but even to a spectral one.",

  abstract  = "Abstract Aim Species distribution modelling, a family of
               statistical methods that predicts species distributions from a
               set of occurrences and environmental predictors, is now
               routinely applied in many macroecological studies. However, the
               reliability of evaluation metrics usually employed to validate
               these models remains questioned. Moreover, the emergence of
               online databases of environmental variables with global
               coverage, especially climatic, has favoured the use of the same
               set of standard predictors. Unfortunately, the selection of
               variables is too rarely based on a careful examination of the
               species' ecology. In this context, our aim was to highlight the
               importance of selecting ad hoc variables in species distribution
               models, and to assess the ability of classical evaluation
               statistics to identify models with no biological realism.
               Innovation First, we reviewed the current practices in the field
               of species distribution modelling in terms of variable selection
               and model evaluation. Then, we computed distribution models of
               509 European species using pseudo?predictors derived from
               paintings or using a real set of climatic and topographic
               predictors. We calculated model performance based on the area
               under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and true skill
               statistics (TSS), partitioning occurrences into training and
               test data with different levels of spatial independence. Most
               models computed from pseudo?predictors were classified as good
               and sometimes were even better evaluated than models computed
               using real environmental variables. However, on average they
               were better discriminated when the partitioning of occurrences
               allowed testing for model transferability. Main conclusions
               These findings confirm the crucial importance of variable
               selection and the inability of current evaluation metrics to
               assess the biological significance of distribution models. We
               recommend that researchers carefully select variables according
               to the species' ecology and evaluate models only according to
               their capacity to be transfered in distant areas. Nevertheless,
               statistics of model evaluations must still be interpreted with
               great caution.",

               Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological
               causes and consequences of global climate change, require the
               interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of
               space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is
               no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be
               studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a
               range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The
               observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the
               system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary
               significance, since every organism is an 'observer' of the
               environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and
               dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the
               observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance
               for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that
               are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and
               biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding
               lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed
               patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different
               scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some
               cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging form the
               collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units.
               In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale
               constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of
               how pattern and variability change with the scale of
               description, and the development of laws for simplification,
               aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and

               The observatory will consist of a spacecraft in low-Earth orbit
               with a two-sensor payload. One sensor, the Operational Land
               Imager (OLI), will collect image data for nine shortwave
               spectral bands over a 185km swath with a 30m spatial resolution
               for all bands except a 15m panchromatic band. The other
               instrument, the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), will collect
               image data for two thermal bands with a 100m resolution over a
               185km swath. Both sensors offer technical advancements over

               land surface characterization product and Landsat ETM+ data to
               predict ETM+ reflectance on the same, an antecedent, or
               subsequent date is presented. The method may be used for ETM+
               cloud/cloud shadow and SLC-off gap filling and for relative
               radiometric normalization. It is demonstrated over three study
               sites, one in Africa and two in the U.S. (Oregon and Idaho) that
               were selected to encompass a range of land cover land use types
               and temporal variations in solar illumination, land cover, land
               use, and phenology. Specifically, the 30 m ETM+ spectral
               reflectance is predicted for a desired date as the product of
               observed ETM+ reflectance and the ratio of the 500 m surface
               reflectance modeled using the MODIS BRDF spectral model
               parameters and the sun-sensor geometry on the predicted and
               observed Landsat dates. The difference between the predicted and
               observed ETM+ reflectance (prediction residual) is compared with
               the difference between the ETM+ reflectance observed on the two
               dates (temporal residual) and with respect to the MODIS BRDF
               model parameter quality. For all three scenes, and all but the
               shortest wavelength band, the mean prediction residual is
               smaller than the mean temporal residual, by up to a factor of
               three. The accuracy is typically higher at ETM+ pixel locations
               where the MODIS BRDF model parameters are derived using the best
               quality inversions. The method is most accurate for the ETM+
               near-infrared (NIR) band; mean NIR prediction residuals are 9\%,
               12\% and 14\% of the mean NIR scene reflectance of the African,
               Oregon and Idaho sites respectively. The developed fusion
               approach may be applied to any high spatial resolution satellite
               data, does not require any tuning parameters and so may be
               automated, is applied on a per-pixel basis and is unaffected by
               the presence of missing or contaminated neighboring Landsat
               pixels, accommodates for temporal variations due to surface

  abstract  = "ABSTRACT A wide range of modelling algorithms is used by
               ecologists, conservation practitioners, and others to predict
               species ranges from point locality data. Unfortunately, the
               amount of data available is limited for many taxa and regions,
               making it essential to quantify the sensitivity of these
               algorithms to sample size. This is the first study to address
               this need by rigorously evaluating a broad suite of algorithms
               with independent presence?absence data from multiple species and
               regions. We evaluated predictions from 12 algorithms for 46
               species (from six different regions of the world) at three
               sample sizes (100, 30, and 10 records). We used data from
               natural history collections to run the models, and evaluated the
               quality of model predictions with area under the receiver
               operating characteristic curve (AUC). With decreasing sample
               size, model accuracy decreased and variability increased across
               species and between models. Novel modelling methods that
               incorporate both interactions between predictor variables and
               complex response shapes (i.e. GBM, MARS?INT, BRUTO) performed
               better than most methods at large sample sizes but not at the
               smallest sample sizes. Other algorithms were much less sensitive
               to sample size, including an algorithm based on maximum entropy
               (MAXENT) that had among the best predictive power across all
               sample sizes. Relative to other algorithms, a distance metric
               algorithm (DOMAIN) and a genetic algorithm (OM?GARP) had
               intermediate performance at the largest sample size and among
               the best performance at the lowest sample size. No algorithm
               predicted consistently well with small sample size (n < 30) and
               this should encourage highly conservative use of predictions
               based on small sample size and restrict their use to exploratory

                     designed as Calibration Home Base (CHB) for the imaging
                     spectrometer APEX, the laboratory can be used to
                     characterise nearly every airborne hyperspectral system.
                     Characterisation methods will be demonstrated exemplarily
                     with HySpex, an airborne imaging spectrometer system from
                     Norsk Elektro Optikks A/S (NEO). Consisting of two
                     separate devices (VNIR-1600 and SWIR-320me) the setup
                     covers the spectral range from 400 nm to 2500 nm. Both
                     airborne sensors have been characterised at NEO. This
                     includes measurement of spectral and spatial resolution
                     and misregistration, polarisation sensitivity, signal to
                     noise ratios and the radiometric response. The same
                     parameters have been examined at the CHB and were used to
                     validate the NEO measurements. Additionally, the line
                     spread functions (LSF) in across and along track direction
                     and the spectral response functions (SRF) for certain
                     detector pixels were measured. The high degree of lab
                     automation allows the determination of the SRFs and LSFs
                     for a large amount of sampling points. Despite this, the
                     measurement of these functions for every detector element
                     would be too time-consuming as typical detectors have 105
                     elements. But with enough sampling points it is possible
                     to interpolate the attributes of the remaining pixels. The
                     knowledge of these properties for every detector element
                     allows the quantification of spectral and spatial
                     misregistration (smile and keystone) and a better
                     calibration of airborne data. Further laboratory

                     spectral and spatial properties of the imaging
                     spectrometers. Compared to the future German spaceborne

                     same or higher spectral and spatial resolution. Therefore,

               decay perspective as quantitative technique to describe
               biogeographic pattern, and to explore whether growth form,
               dispersal type, rarity, or support affected the rate of distance
               decay in similarity. Location North American spruce?fir forests,
               Appalachian montane spruce?fir forests. Methods We estimated
               rates of distance decay through regression of log?transformed
               compositional similarity against distance for pairwise
               comparisons of thirty?four white spruce plots and twenty?six
               black spruce plots distributed from eastern Canada to Alaska,
               six regional floras along the crest of the Appalachians, and six
               regional floras along the east?west extent of the boreal forest.
               Results Similarity decreased significantly with distance, with
               the most linear models relating the log of similarity to
               untransformed distance. The rate of similarity decay was 1.5?1.9
               times higher for vascular plants than for bryophytes. The rate
               of distance decay was highest for berry?fruited and nut?bearing
               species (1.7 times higher than plumose?seeded species and 1.9
               times higher than microseeded/spore species) and 2.1 times
               higher for herbs than woody plants. There was no distance decay
               for rare species, while species of intermediate frequency had
               2.0 times higher distance decay rates than common species. The
               rate of distance decay was 2.7 times higher for floras from the
               fragmented Appalachians than for floras from the contiguous
               boreal forest. Main conclusions The distance decay of similarity
               can be caused by either a decrease in environmental similarity
               with distance (e.g. climatic gradients) or by limits to
               dispersal and niche width differences among taxa. Regardless of
               cause, the distance decay of similarity provides a simple

              For management purposes many wetlands, especially those in dry
              regions, need to be monitored for short and long-term changes.
              Another application of these technologies is monitoring the
              impact of climate change in permafrost transition zones where
              peatlands form one of the major land cover types. Therefore,
              examples from boreal and subtropical environments are presented
              using the analysed ENVISAT ASAR Global mode (GM, 1 km resolution)
              data acquired in 2005 and 2006. In the case of the ENVISAT ASAR
              instrument, data availability of the rather coarse Global Mode
              depends on request priorities of other competing modes, but
              acquisition frequency may still be on average fortnightly to
              monthly depending on latitude. Peatland types covering varying
              permafrost regimes of the West Siberian Lowlands can be
              distinguished from each other and other land cover by
              multi-temporal analyses. Up to 75\% of oligotrophic bogs can be
              identified in the seasonal permafrost zone in both years. The
              high seasonal and inter-annual dynamics of the subtropic Okavango
              Delta can also be captured by GM time series. Response to
              increased precipitation in 2006 differs from flood propagation
              patterns. In addition, relative soil moisture maps may provide a

  abstract  = "The central challenge of the 21st century is to develop
               economic, social, and governance systems capable of ending
               poverty and achieving sustainable levels of population and
               consumption while securing the life-support systems underpinning
               current and future human well-being. Essential to meeting this
               challenge is the incorporation of natural capital and the
               ecosystem services it provides into decision-making. We explore
               progress and crucial gaps at this frontier, reflecting upon the
               10 y since the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. We focus on
               three key dimensions of progress and ongoing challenges: raising
               awareness of the interdependence of ecosystems and human
               well-being, advancing the fundamental interdisciplinary science
               of ecosystem services, and implementing this science in
               decisions to restore natural capital and use it sustainably.
               Awareness of human dependence on nature is at an all-time high,
               the science of ecosystem services is rapidly advancing, and talk
               of natural capital is now common from governments to corporate
               boardrooms. However, successful implementation is still in early
               stages. We explore why ecosystem service information has yet to
               fundamentally change decision-making and suggest a path forward
               that emphasizes: (i) developing solid evidence linking decisions
               to impacts on natural capital and ecosystem services, and then
               to human well-being; (ii) working closely with leaders in
               government, business, and civil society to develop the
               knowledge, tools, and practices necessary to integrate natural
               capital and ecosystem services into everyday decision-making;

               the implications for the sustainable provision of ecosystem
               services. However, a variety of indicators are already being
               used resulting in many, mostly incompatible, monitoring systems.
               In order to synthesise the different indicator approaches and to
               detect gaps in the development of common indicator systems, we
               examined 531 indicators that have been reported in 617
               peer?reviewed journal articles between 1997 and 2007. Special
               emphasis was placed on comparing indicators of biodiversity and
               ecosystem services across ecosystems (forests, grass? and
               shrublands, wetlands, rivers, lakes, soils and agro?ecosystems)
               and spatial scales (from patch to global scale). The application
               of biological indicators was found most often focused on
               regional and finer spatial scales with few indicators applied
               across ecosystem types. Abiotic indicators, such as
               physico?chemical parameters and measures of area and
               fragmentation, are most frequently used at broader (regional to
               continental) scales. Despite its multiple dimensions,
               biodiversity is usually equated with species richness only. The
               functional, structural and genetic components of biodiversity
               are poorly addressed despite their potential value across
               habitats and scales. Ecosystem service indicators are mostly
               used to estimate regulating and supporting services but
               generally differ between ecosystem types as they reflect
               ecosystem?specific services. Despite great effort to develop
               indicator systems over the past decade, there is still a
               considerable gap in the widespread use of indicators for many of
               the multiple components of biodiversity and ecosystem services,
               and a need to develop common monitoring schemes within and
               across habitats. Filling these gaps is a prerequisite for
               linking biodiversity dynamics with ecosystem service delivery
               and to achieving the goals of global and sub?global initiatives

              of foliar nitrogen (N) concentration in plant canopies can be
              achieved with imaging spectroscopy, or hyperspectral remote
              sensing, from satellite or airborne sensors. Development of this
              approach has been fueled by recognition that foliar N is related
              to a variety of ecological and biogeochemical processes, ranging
              from the spread of invasive species to the ecosystem effects of
              insect defoliation events to patterns of N cycling in forest
              soils. To date, most studies have focused on building
              site-specific foliar N detection algorithms applied to individual
              scenes or small landscapes that have been intensively
              characterized with local field measurements. However, the growing
              number of well-measured sites, combined with improvements in
              image data quality and processing methods provide an opportunity
              to begin seeking more general N detection methods that can be
              applied to a broader range of sites or to locations that lack
              intensive field measurements. Here, we combine data from several
              independent efforts in North America, Central America and
              Australia, to examine whether development of calibration methods
              to determine canopy nitrogen concentration across a wide range of
              forest ecosystems is possible. The analysis included data from
              137 individual field plots within eight study sites for which
              imagery has been acquired from NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared
              Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and/or Hyperion instruments. The
              combined dataset was used to evaluate site-specific calibration
              results as well as results obtained with data pooled across all
              sites. We evaluated the accuracy of results using plot- and
              site-level cross-validation wherein individual plots or entire
              sites were withheld and used as an independent validation of the
              resulting algorithms. In instances where all sites were
              represented in the calibration, canopy-level foliar N
              concentration was predicted to within 7--15\% of the mean
              field-measured values indicating a strong potential for broadly
              applied foliar N detection. When whole sites were iteratively
              dropped from the calibration and predicted by remaining data,
              predictions were still significant, but less accurate (7--47\% of
              mean canopy-level N concentration). This suggests that further
              development to include a wider range of ecosystems will be
              necessary before cross-site prediction accuracy approaches that
              seen in site-specific calibrations. Nevertheless, we view these
              results as promising, particularly given the potential value of
              foliar N estimates, even at a reduced level of confidence, at
              sites for which there is no possibility of conducting field data

              strategic goals, with indicators showing the level of progress
              made towards each target. Currently, measurements of many ABT
              indicators are not available. The Essential Biodiversity Variable
              (EBV) framework, developed by the Group on Earth Observations

              coherent and harmonised set of observations of biodiversity. In

              (EO) as a tool to support biodiversity monitoring against the ABT
              and EBV frameworks. We show that EO?based measurements are
              adequate for assessing progress towards 11 out of 20 ABTs. In
              addition, 14 of the 22 candidate EBVs have a fully or partly

              assessed with both fully and partly measured RS?EBVs, assessing
              trends is more challenging, particularly for partly measured
              RS?EBVs, as coincident time series of EO and supporting data are

               forecasts provide the opportunity to iteratively cycle between
               performing analyses and updating predictions in light of new
               evidence. This iterative process of gaining feedback, building
               experience, and correcting models and methods is critical for
               improving forecasts. Iterative, near-term forecasting will
               accelerate ecological research, make it more relevant to
               society, and inform sustainable decision-making under high
               uncertainty and adaptive management. Here, we identify the
               immediate scientific and societal needs, opportunities, and
               challenges for iterative near-term ecological forecasting. Over
               the past decade, data volume, variety, and accessibility have
               greatly increased, but challenges remain in interoperability,
               latency, and uncertainty quantification. Similarly, ecologists
               have made considerable advances in applying computational,
               informatic, and statistical methods, but opportunities exist for
               improving forecast-specific theory, methods, and

              extinctions. Therefore, humanity needs to address anthropogenic
              population extirpation and decimation immediately. That
              conclusion is based on analyses of the numbers and degrees of
              range contraction (indicative of population shrinkage and/or
              population extinctions according to the International Union for
              Conservation of Nature) using a sample of 27,600 vertebrate
              species, and on a more detailed analysis documenting the
              population extinctions between 1900 and 2015 in 177 mammal
              species. We find that the rate of population loss in terrestrial
              vertebrates is extremely high-even in ``species of low concern.''
              In our sample, comprising nearly half of known vertebrate
              species, 32\% (8,851/27,600) are decreasing; that is, they have
              decreased in population size and range. In the 177 mammals for
              which we have detailed data, all have lost 30\% or more of their
              geographic ranges and more than 40\% of the species have
              experienced severe population declines (>80\% range shrinkage).
              Our data indicate that beyond global species extinctions Earth is
              experiencing a huge episode of population declines and
              extirpations, which will have negative cascading consequences on

              (LiDAR) system to detect top-of-canopy tree height (TCH) and ACD

              TCH and ACD were highly correlated across a wide range of forest
              ages and types. Top-of-canopy height (TCH) reached 67 m, and ACD
              surpassed 225 Mg C ha-1, indicating both that airborne CAO
              LiDAR-based estimates of ACD are accurate in tall, high-biomass
              forests and that the Osa Peninsula harbors some of the most
              carbon-rich forests in the Neotropics. We also examined the
              relative influence of lithologic, topoedaphic and climatic
              factors on regional patterns in ACD, which are known to influence
              ACD by regulating forest productivity and turnover. Analyses
              revealed a spatially nested set of factors controlling ACD
              patterns, with geologic variation explaining up to 16\% of the
              mapped ACD variation at the regional scale, while local variation
              in topographic slope explained an additional 18\%. Lithologic and
              topoedaphic factors also explained more ACD variation at 30-m
              than at 100-m spatial resolution, suggesting that environmental
              filtering depends on the spatial scale of terrain variation. Our
              result indicate that patterns in ACD are partially controlled by
              spatial variation in geologic history and geomorphic processes
              underpinning topographic diversity across landscapes. ACD also
              exhibited spatial autocorrelation, which may reflect biological
              processes that influence ACD, such as the assembly of species or
              phenotypes across the landscape, but additional research is
              needed to resolve how abiotic and biotic factors contribute to
              ACD variation across high biomass, high diversity tropical

               synthetic landcover data and simulated species-environment
               models. Several key findings emerged from this research.
               Firstly, it found that mapping error was highest when the scale
               of the feature and the raster grid coincided. Ecologically
               important landscape elements such as small and linear vegetation
               patches of similar scales to the raster grid had lower
               classification accuracies, and were less likely to be extracted
               than larger more compact features. Secondly, this thesis showed
               that at coarser scales, subtle levels of patchiness declined.
               Small patches either aggregated into larger patches or
               completely disappeared. Thirdly, it demonstrated that the
               ability to identify the scale at which a species interacts with
               the environment, using multi-scale species-environment models is
               affected by the scale of the remote sensing data. In conclusion,
               this thesis quantified the impact of scale on the classification
               of landcover maps and demonstrated how spatial uncertainty in
               the characterisation of landscape pattern can impact on
               ecological analysis. Without the incorporation of uncertainty
               arising from scale, ecological analyses using remote sensing
               data will continue to produce results with unquantified

               plant, soil, and ecosystem carbon storage data from two

              data syntheses have found mixed evidence for patterns of net
              species loss at local spatial scales. For example, two recent
              data meta-analyses have found that species richness is decreasing
              in some locations and is increasing in others. When these trends
              are combined, these papers argued there has been no net change in
              species richness, and suggested this pattern is globally
              representative of biodiversity change at local scales. Here we
              reanalyze results of these data syntheses and outline why this
              conclusion is unfounded. First, we show the datasets collated for
              these syntheses are spatially biased and not representative of
              the spatial distribution of species richness or the distribution
              of many primary drivers of biodiversity change. This casts doubt
              that their results are representative of global patterns. Second,
              we argue that detecting the trend in local species richness is
              very difficult with short time series and can lead to biased
              estimates of change. Reanalyses of the data detected a signal of
              study duration on biodiversity change, indicating net
              biodiversity loss is most apparent in studies of longer duration.
              Third, estimates of species richness change can be biased if
              species gains during post-disturbance recovery are included
              without also including species losses that occurred during the
              disturbance. Net species gains or losses should be assessed with
              respect to common baselines or reference communities. Ultimately,
              we need a globally coordinated effort to monitor biodiversity so
              that we can estimate and attribute human impacts as causes of
              biodiversity change. A combination of technologies will be needed
              to produce regularly updated global datasets of local
              biodiversity change to guide future policy. At this time the

              cover in our study region is embedded in countryside forest
              elements, small (typically 0.05-100 ha) clusters or strips of
              trees on private property. Third, most species use multiple
              habitat types, including crop fields and pastures (to which 15\%
              of species are restricted), although some taxa depend on forest
              (57\% of species are restricted to forest elements). Our findings
              are supported by comparisons of 90 studies across Latin America.

  abstract = "Abstract Remote sensing (RS) is a powerful tool to measure and
              monitor Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) and their
              environmental drivers. Despite this potential, stronger
              integration between remote sensing experts and the ecological
              community could better support biodiversity initiatives. Here we
              highlight opportunities to harness remote sensing technology to
              better understand biodiversity patterns, ecological processes and
              the consequences for ecosystem services (ESs). We argue that
              tracking many EBVs using remote sensing should prioritize the
              monitoring of dominant species, a scalable property across
              multiple EBV classes, for several reasons. First, a few dominant
              species in an ecological community disproportionately contribute
              to the satellite spectral signature. Second, a focus on dominance
              would enable a stronger links to ecological research, as
              dominance reflects the ecological community context (i.e.
              relative abundance of coexisting species). For example dominant
              species should be especially important contributors to many
              ecosystem functions and services that rely on abundance or
              biomass, such as carbon storage or nutrient cycling, because of
              their greater representation in a community. Furthermore, global
              change impacts on communities may be reflected in changing
              dominance structure before the losses of species, thus tracking
              dominance provides an early?warning sign of community change for
              EBVs. Finally, focusing on dominant species should improve
              understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics of
              dominance?driven ESs through RS mapping. Given the importance of
              dominant species to ecological communities and ESs, monitoring
              dominance under changing environmental conditions and human
              impacts should be a global priority.",

               richness rely on the overlaying of extent-of-occurrence range
               maps. Because a species does not occur at all locations within
               its geographic range, range-map-derived data represent actual
               distributional patterns only at some relatively coarse and
               undefined resolution. With the increasing availability of
               high-resolution climate and land-cover data, broad-scale studies
               are increasingly likely to estimate richness at high
               resolutions. Because of the scale dependence of most ecological
               phenomena, a significant mismatch between the presumed and
               actual scale of ecological data may arise. This may affect
               conclusions regarding basic drivers of diversity and may lead to
               errors in the identification of diversity hotspots. Here, we
               examine avian range maps of 834 bird species in conjunction with
               geographically extensive survey data sets on two continents to
               determine the spatial resolutions at which range-map data
               actually characterize species occurrences and patterns of
               species richness. At resolutions less than 2 degrees (
               approximately 200 km), range maps overestimate the area of
               occupancy of individual species and mis-characterize spatial
               patterns of species richness, resulting in up to two-thirds of
               biodiversity hotspots being misidentified. The scale dependence
               of range-map accuracy poses clear limitations on broad-scale
               ecological analyses and conservation assessments. We suggest

              survey priorities",
  author   = "Brito, Daniel",
  abstract = "Knowledge of biodiversity is woefully inadequate. Only a fraction
              of the planet's species has been described by science (the
              ``Linnean shortfall''). Even for described species, scientists
              often have only fragmentary information about their distributions

              knowledge place serious limitations on the ability to conserve
              biodiversity in the face of the ongoing extinction crisis. Here,
              I test the hypothesis that data deficiency may be used to guide
              surveys and inventories to regions that would increase the
              probability of discovering new species. I compiled global
              distribution maps for all Data Deficient amphibian species
              (species described up to 2004) and constructed a Data Deficiency
              (DD) surface (the DD surface was based on distribution
              information obtained from the IUCN Red List). Then, I compared
              the type-locality sites of new amphibian species descriptions
              (species described between 2005 and 2009) with the DD surface in
              order to check if new species discoveries were significantly more
              abundant within the DD surface or not. Even though the amphibian
              DD species surface covers only 8\% of Earth's land area, 79\% of
              the amphibian species discovered between 2005 and 2009 were
              within the DD surface. The results suggest that directing surveys
              towards areas of known data deficiency will likely result in the
              discovery of species new to science, helping to address the
              Linnean shortfall. Incorporating DD information from the IUCN Red
              List may provide an efficient methodology for strategically
              targeting surveys and inventories, maximizing the chances of
              obtaining high conservation benefits from them, and helping
              minimize the costs associated with such endeavours.
              Zusammenfassung Die Kenntnis der Biodiversit{\"a}t ist von
              trauriger Unzul{\"a}nglichkeit. Nur ein Bruchteil der Arten
              dieses Planeten wurden wissenschaftlich beschrieben (das
              ``Linneische Defizit''). Selbst bei den beschriebenen Arten
              verf{\"u}gt die Wissenschaft oft nur {\"u}ber fragmentarische
              Informationen zu ihrer Verbreitung (das ``Wallacesche Defizit'').
              Diese Wissendefizite schr{\"a}nken die F{\"a}higkeit,
              Biodiversit{\"a}t angesichts des gegenw{\"a}rtigen Artenschwundes
              zu sch{\"u}tzen, erheblich ein. Hier {\"u}berpr{\"u}fe ich die
              Hypothese, dass fehlende Information (Data Deficiency: DD)
              genutzt werden k{\"o}nnte, um Erkundungen und Bestandsaufnahmen
              in solche Regionen zu lenken, in denen die Wahrscheinlichkeit
              neue Arten zu entdecken hoch ist. Ich stellte globale
              Verbreitungskarten f{\"u}r alle Amphibienarten (bis zum
              Erstbeschreibungsjahr 2004) mit unzul{\"a}nglich bekannter (DD)
              Verbreitung zusammen und konstruierte eine DD-Oberfl{\"a}che.
              Diese DD-Oberfl{\"a}che basierte auf den Verbreitungsangaben in
              der IUCN Roten Liste. Dann verglich ich die Typusfundorte von
              neuen Amphibienbeschreibungen (2005 bis 2009) mit der
              DD-Oberfl{\"a}che, um zu {\"u}berpr{\"u}fen, ob neu entdeckte
              Arten signifikant h{\"a}ufiger innerhalb der DD-Oberfl{\"a}che
              auftraten oder nicht. Obwohl die DD-Oberfl{\"a}che der
              Amphibienarten nur 8\% der Landfl{\"a}che der Erde einnimmt,
              fanden sich 79\% der von 2005 bis 2009 neu entdeckten Arten
              innerhalb der DD-Oberfl{\"a}che. Die Ergebnisse legen nahe, dass
              der Ansatz, Erkundungen in Gebiete mit bekannt geringem
              Wissensstand zur Artverbreitung zu richten, wahrscheinlich zur
              Entdeckung neuer Arten f{\"u}hren wird und damit helfen kann, das
              Linneische Defizit anzugehen. DD-Informationen aus der IUCN Roten
              Liste zu ber{\"u}cksichtigen, k{\"o}nnte eine effektive Methode
              sein, Erkundungen und Bestandsaufnahmen strategisch zu planen.

               problems, provide tools to overcome these issues, and quantify
               the performance of correctly stacked S-SDMs alongside
               macroecological models. Locations Barents Sea, Europe and Dutch
               Wadden Sea. Methods We present formal mathematical arguments
               demonstrating how S-SDMs should and should not be stacked. We
               then compare the performance of macroecological models and
               correctly stacked S-SDMs on the same data to determine if the
               former can be used to constrain the latter. Next, we develop a
               maximum-likelihood approach to adjusting S-SDMs and discuss how
               it could potentially be used in combination with macroecological
               models. Finally, we use this tool to quantify how S-SDMs deviate
               from observed richness in four very different case studies.
               Results We demonstrate that stacking methods based on
               thresholding site-level occurrence probabilities will almost
               always be biased, and that these biases will tend toward
               systematic overprediction of richness. Next, we show that
               correctly stacked S-SDMs perform very similarly to
               macroecological models in that they both have a tendency to
               overpredict richness in species-poor sites and underpredict it
               in species-rich sites. Main conclusions Our results suggest that
               the perception that S-SDMs consistently overpredict richness is
               driven largely by incorrect stacking methods. With these biases
               removed, S-SDMs perform similarly to macroecological models,
               suggesting that combining the two model classes will not offer
               much improvement. However, if situations where coupling S-SDMs
               and macroecological models would be beneficial are subsequently
               identified, the tools we develop would facilitate such a
               synthesis.",

               related niche studies has increased dramatically in recent
               years, with several books and reviews being prepared since 2000.
               The earliest SDM studies are dealt with only briefly even in the
               books. Consequently, many researchers are unaware of when the
               first SDM software package (bioclim) was developed and how a
               broad range of applications using the package was explored
               within the first 8 years following its release. The purpose of
               this study is to clarify these early developments and initial
               applications, as well as to highlight bioclim's continuing
               relevance to current studies. Location Mainly Australia and New
               Zealand, but also some global applications. Methods We outline
               the development of the bioclim package, early applications
               (1984?1991) and its current relevance. Results bioclim was the
               first SDM package to be widely used. Early applications explored
               many of the possible uses of SDMs in conservation biogeography,
               such as quantifying the environmental niche of species,
               identifying areas where a species might be invasive, assisting
               conservation planning and assessing the likely impacts of
               climate change on species distributions. Main conclusions
               Understanding this pioneering work is worthwhile as bioclim was
               for many years one of the leading SDM packages and remains
               widely used. Climate interpolation methods developed for bioclim
               were used to create the WorldClim database, the most common
               source of climate data for SDM studies, and bioclim variables
               are used in about 76\% of recent published MaxEnt analyses of
               terrestrial ecosystems. Also, some of the bioclim studies from
               the late 1980s, such as measuring niche (both realized and
               fundamental) and assessing possible impacts of climate change,

               environmental layers used in modelling is one important factor
               that may affect predictions. We applied 10 distinct modelling
               techniques to presence?only data for 50 species in five
               different regions, to test whether: (1) a 10?fold coarsening of
               resolution affects predictive performance of SDMs, and (2) any
               observed effects are dependent on the type of region, modelling
               technique, or species considered. Results show that a 10 times
               change in grain size does not severely affect predictions from
               species distribution models. The overall trend is towards
               degradation of model performance, but improvement can also be
               observed. Changing grain size does not equally affect models
               across regions, techniques, and species types. The strongest
               effect is on regions and species types, with tree species in the
               data sets (regions) with highest locational accuracy being most
               affected. Changing grain size had little influence on the
               ranking of techniques: boosted regression trees remain best at
               both resolutions. The number of occurrences used for model
               training had an important effect, with larger sample sizes
               resulting in better models, which tended to be more sensitive to
               grain. Effect of grain change was only noticeable for models

  author   = "Maillard, Philippe and Alencar-Silva, Thiago and Clausi, David A",
  abstract = "Veredas (palm swamps) are wetland complexes associated with the
              Brazilian savanna (cerrado) that often represent the only
              available source of water for the ecosystem during the dry
              months. Their extent and condition are mainly unknown and their
              cartography is an essential issue for their protection. This
              research article evaluates some of the fine resolution satellite
              data both in the radar (Radarsat-1) and optical domain (ASTER)
              for the delineation and characterization of veredas. Two separate
              approaches are evaluated. First, given the known potential of
              Radarsat-1 images for wetland inventories, the automatic
              delineation of veredas is tested using only Radarsat-1 data and a
              Markov random fields region-based segmentation. In this case, to
              increase performance, processing is limited to a buffer zone
              around the river network. Then, characterization of their type is
              attempted using traditional classification methods of ASTER
              optical data combined with Radarsat-1 data. The automatic
              classification of Radarsat data yielded results with an overall
              accuracy between 62 and 69\%, that proved reliable enough for
              delineating wide and very humid veredas. Scenes from the wet
              season and with a smaller angle of incidence systematically
              yielded better results. For the classification of the main
              vegetation types, better results (overall success of 78.8\%) were
              obtained by using only the visible and near infrared (VNIR) bands
              of the ASTER image. Radarsat data did not bring any improvement
              to these classification results. In fact, when using solely the
              Radarsat data from two different angle of incidence and two
              different dates, the classification results were low (50.8\%) but
              remained powerful for delineating the permanently moist riparian
              forest portion of the veredas with an accuracy better than 75\%
              in most cases. These results are considered good given the width
              of some types often less than 50 m wide compared with the
              resolution of the images (12.5 - 15 m). Comparing the
              classification results with the Radarsat-generated delineation
              allows an understanding of the relation between synthetic

              remote sensing data",

  abstract = "The monitoring of earth surface dynamic processes requires global
              observations of the structure and the functioning of vegetation.
              Moderate resolution sensors (with pixel size ranging from 250 m
              to 7 km) provide frequent estimates of biophysical variables to
              characterize vegetation such as the leaf area index (LAI).
              However, the computation of LAI from moderate resolution remote
              sensing data induces a scaling bias on the LAI estimate if the
              moderate resolution pixel is heterogeneous and if the transfer
              function that relates remote sensing data to LAI is non-linear.
              This study provides a model to evaluate and correct the scaling
              bias. The model is built first for a univariate semi-empirical
              transfer function relating LAI directly to NDVI. The scaling bias
              is a function of (i) the degree of non-linearity of the transfer
              function quantified by its second derivative and (ii) the spatial
              heterogeneity of the moderate resolution pixel quantified by the
              variogram of the high spatial resolution (20 m) NDVI image. Then,
              the model is extended to a bivariate transfer function where LAI
              is related to red and near infrared reflectances. The scaling
              bias depends on (i) the Hessian matrix of the transfer function
              and (ii) the variograms and cross variogram of the red and near
              infrared reflectances. The scaling bias is investigated on
              several distinct landscapes from the VALERI database. Adjusting
              for scaling bias is critical on crop sites which are the most
              heterogeneous sites at the landscape level. Regarding the
              univariate transfer function, the magnitude of the scaling bias
              increases rapidly with pixel size until this size is larger than
              the typical spatial scale of the data. For the bivariate transfer
              function, it results from the addition of several components that
              may add up or cancel each other out. It is thus more difficult to
              analyze. The accuracy of the model to estimate the scaling bias
              is discussed. It depends mainly on the ability of the variograms
              and cross variogram to represent the local dispersion variances
              and covariance within the moderate resolution pixel. The model is
              generally highly accurate at 1000 m spatial resolution for the
              univariate transfer function and less accurate for the bivariate
              transfer function.",

  abstract = "Terrestrial net primary production (NPP) is sensitive to a number
              of controls, including aspects of climate, topography, soils,
              plant and microbial characteristics, disturbance, and
              anthropogenic impacts. Yet, at least at the global scale, models
              based on very different types and numbers of parameters yield
              similar results. Part of the reason for this is that the major
              NPP controls influence each other, resulting, under current
              conditions, in broad correlations among controls. NPP models that
              include richer suites of controlling parameters should be more
              sensitive to conditions that disrupt the broad correlations, but
              the current paucity of global data limits the power of complex
              models. Improved data sets will facilitate applications of
              complex models, but many of the critical data are very difficult
              to produce, especially for applications dealing with the past or
              future. It may be possible to overcome some of the challenges of
              data availability through increased understanding and modeling of
              ecological processes that adjust plant physiology and
              architecture in relation to resources. The CASA (Carnegie,
              Stanford, Ames Approach) model introduced by Potter et al. (1993)

              satellite data, and surface data to predict terrestrial NPP on a
              monthly time step. CASA calculates NPP as a product of absorbed
              photosynthetically active radiation, APAR, and an efficiency of
              radiation use, ϵ. The underlying postulate is that some of the
              limitations on NPP appear in each. CASA estimates annual
              terrestrial NPP to be 48 Pg and the maximum efficiency of PAR
              utilization (ϵ∗) to be 0.39 g C MJ−1 PAR. Spatial and temporal
              variation in APAR is more than fivefold greater than variation in

               near-infrared (NIR). For standing litter material, minimum
               variation occurred in the VIS/NIR, while the largest differences
               were observed in the shortwave-IR (SWIR). Woody stem material
               showed opposite trends, with lowest variation in the SWIR and
               highest in the NIR. Leaf area index (LAI) and leaf angle
               distribution (LAD) were the dominant controls on canopy
               reflectance data with the exception of soil reflectance and
               vegetation cover in sparse canopies. Leaf optical properties
               (and thus foliar chemistry) were expressed most directly at the
               canopy level in the NIR, but LAI and LAD strongly controlled the
               relationship between leaf and canopy spectral characteristics.
               Stem material played a small but significant role in determining
               canopy reflectance in woody plant canopies, especially those
               with LAI<5.0. Standing litter significantly affected the
               reflectance characteristics of grassland canopies; small
               increases in the percentage of standing litter had a
               disproportionately large affect on canopy reflectance. The
               structural attributes of ecosystems determine the relative
               contribution of tissue, canopy, and landscape factors that drive
               variation in a reflectance signal. Deconvolution of these
               factors requires an understanding of the sources of variance at
               each scale (which is ecosystem dependent) as well as an adequate
               sampling (spectral, angular, and temporal) of the shortwave
               (400--2500 nm) spectrum.",

              understanding of how human modification influences ecosystem
              processes and these relationships are most accurate when based on
              functional traits. Although trait variation is typically sampled
              at local scales, remote sensing methods can facilitate scaling up
              trait variation to regional scales needed for ecosystem service
              management. We review concepts and methods for scaling up plant
              and animal functional traits from local to regional spatial
              scales with the goal of assessing impacts of human modification
              on ecosystem processes and services. We focus our objectives on
              considerations and approaches for (1) conducting local plot-level
              sampling of trait variation and (2) scaling up trait variation to
              regional spatial scales using remotely sensed data. We show that
              sampling methods for scaling up traits need to account for the
              modification of trait variation due to land cover change and
              species introductions. Sampling intraspecific variation,
              stratification by land cover type or landscape context, or
              inference of traits from published sources may be necessary
              depending on the traits of interest. Passive and active remote
              sensing are useful for mapping plant phenological, chemical, and
              structural traits. Combining these methods can significantly
              improve their capacity for mapping plant trait variation. These
              methods can also be used to map landscape and vegetation
              structure in order to infer animal trait variation. Due to high
              context dependency, relationships between trait variation and
              remotely sensed data are not directly transferable across
              regions. We end our review with a brief synthesis of issues to
              consider and outlook for the development of these approaches.

              the community-weighted mean, with remote sensing data and that
              relates variation in traits that cannot be remotely sensed to

               central role in many ecological theories, for instance the

               the spatial structure of biological populations and communities
               can be studied. We first demonstrate that many of the basic
               statistical methods used in ecological studies are impaired by
               autocorrelated data. Most if not all environmental data fall in
               this category. We will look briefly at ways of performing valid
               statistical tests in the presence of spatial autocorrelation.

               patterns of the ecosystem properties of Amazonia, and focuses on
               two parts of the main components of the net primary production:
               the long-lived carbon pools (wood) and short-lived pools
               (leaves). First, the focus is on forest biophysical properties,
               and secondly, on the macro-scale leaf phenological patterns of
               these forests, looking at field measurements and bringing into
               discussion the recent findings derived from remote sensing
               dataset. Finally, I discuss the results of the three major
               droughts that hit Amazonia in the last 15 years. The panorama
               that emerges from this review suggests that slow growing forests
               in central and eastern Amazonia, where soils are poorer, have
               significantly higher above ground biomass and higher wood
               density, trees are higher and present lower proportions of
               large-leaved species than stands in northwest and southwest
               Amazonia. However, the opposite pattern is observed in relation
               to forest productivity and dynamism, which is higher in western
               Amazonia than in central and eastern forests. The spatial
               patterns on leaf phenology across Amazonia are less marked.
               Field data from different forest formations showed that new leaf
               production can be unrelated to climate seasonality, timed with
               radiation, timed with rainfall and/or river levels. Oppositely,
               satellite images exhibited a large-scale synchronized peak in
               new leaf production during the dry season. Satellite data and
               field measurements bring contrasting results for the 2005
               drought. Discussions on data processing and filtering, aerosols
               effects and a combined analysis with field and satellite images
               are presented. It is suggested that to improve the understanding
               of the large-scale patterns on Amazonian forests, integrative
               analyses that combine new technologies in remote sensing and
               long-term field ecological data are imperative.",

              for helping to coordinate and structure biodiversity monitoring
              efforts worldwide. Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) has
              considerable potential to inform these initiatives. To date,
              however, discussions on the role of SRS in supporting these
              frameworks have mostly evolved independently; tend to be led by
              different groups; sometimes target slightly different scales; and
              are likely to reach different audiences. Because of this, there
              is some confusion among environmental managers and policymakers
              as to what the potential of SRS is or whether there is prospect
              in considering and promoting the use of satellite data for
              biodiversity conservation. 2. Here, we provide a brief overview
              of the role of SRS to date in informing these frameworks. Through
              a case study focused on the Sahara Desert ecosystem, we also
              demonstrate the current potential for SRS?based methodologies to
              support conservation in data?deficient areas and discuss the
              relative applicability of SRS?based metrics to each of these
              frameworks. 3. The relevance and use of SRS across the four
              frameworks are clearly variable, due to differences and ambiguity
              in definitions, and due to differences in monitoring priorities.
              Our case study illustrates the particularly high potential for
              SRS approaches to provide key information relevant to the
              Biodiversity Indicators framework in desert ecosystems; it also
              identifies SRS?based metrics relevant to all frameworks. 4.
              Altogether, this work highlights how more dialogue is required
              within the biodiversity?monitoring community for SRS to reach its
              full potential in conservation. In particular, agreement on what
              is needed in priority, given the realm of what is possible, will
              be of paramount importance to developing SRS?based products that

               mainly from the ad hoc nature of collecting effort. This problem
               has been frequently cited but rarely addressed in a systematic
               manner. We have developed a methodology to evaluate museum
               collection data, in particular the reliability of distributional
               data for narrow?range taxa. We included only those taxa for
               which there were an appropriate number of records, expert
               verification of identifications, and acceptable locality
               accuracy. First, we compared the available data for the taxon of
               interest to the ?background data,? comprised of records for
               those organisms likely to be captured by the same methods or by
               the same collectors as the taxon of interest. The ?adequacy?of
               background sampling effort was assessed through calculation of
               statistics describing the separation, density, and clustering of
               points, and through generation of a sampling density contour
               surface. Geographical information systems (GIS) technology was
               then used to model predicted distributions of species based on
               abiotic (e.g., climatic and geological) data. The robustness of
               these predicted distributions can be tested iteratively or by
               bootstrapping. Together, these methods provide an objective
               means to assess the likelihood of the distributions obtained
               from museum collection records representing true distributions.
               Potentially, they could be used to evaluate any point data to be
               collated in species maps, biodiversity assessment, or similar

               citizen science data make temporally and spatially extensive
               species' observation data available to a wide range of users.
               Such data have limitations however, which include: sampling bias
               in favour of recorder distribution, lack of survey effort
               assessment, and lack of coverage of the distribution of all
               organisms. These limitations are not always recorded, while any
               technical assessment or scientific research based on such data
               should include an evaluation of the uncertainty of its source
               data and researchers should acknowledge this information in
               their analysis. The here proposed maps of ignorance are a
               critical and easy way to implement a tool to not only visually
               explore the quality of the data, but also to filter out
               unreliable results. NEW INFORMATION: I present simple algorithms
               to display ignorance maps as a tool to report the spatial
               distribution of the bias and lack of sampling effort across a
               study region. Ignorance scores are expressed solely based on raw
               data in order to rely on the fewest assumptions possible.
               Therefore there is no prediction or estimation involved. The
               rationale is based on the assumption that it is appropriate to
               use species groups as a surrogate for sampling effort because it
               is likely that an entire group of species observed by similar
               methods will share similar bias. Simple algorithms are then used
               to transform raw data into ignorance scores scaled 0-1 that are
               easily comparable and scalable. Because of the need to perform
               calculations over big datasets, simplicity is crucial for
               web-based implementations on infrastructures for biodiversity
               information. With these algorithms, any infrastructure for
               biodiversity information can offer a quality report of the
               observations accessed through them. Users can specify a
               reference taxonomic group and a time frame according to the
               research question. The potential of this tool lies in the
               simplicity of its algorithms and in the lack of assumptions made
               about the bias distribution, giving the user the freedom to
               tailor analyses to their specific needs.",

              estimating extinction rates and a pillar of conservation science.
              The default strategy for conserving biodiversity is the
              designation of nature reserves, treated as islands in an
              inhospitable sea of human activity. Despite the profound
              influence of islands on conservation theory and practice, their
              mainland analogues, forest fragments in human-dominated
              landscapes, consistently defy expected biodiversity patterns
              based on island biogeography theory. Countryside biogeography is
              an alternative framework, which recognizes that the fate of the
              world's wildlife will be decided largely by the hospitality of
              agricultural or countryside ecosystems. Here we directly test
              these biogeographic theories by comparing a Neotropical
              countryside ecosystem with a nearby island ecosystem, and show
              that each supports similar bat biodiversity in fundamentally
              different ways. The island ecosystem conforms to island
              biogeographic predictions of bat species loss, in which the water
              matrix is not habitat. In contrast, the countryside ecosystem has
              high species richness and evenness across forest reserves and
              smaller forest fragments. Relative to forest reserves and
              fragments, deforested countryside habitat supports a less
              species-rich, yet equally even, bat assemblage. Moreover, the bat
              assemblage associated with deforested habitat is compositionally
              novel because of predictable changes in abundances by many
              species using human-made habitat. Finally, we perform a global
              meta-analysis of bat biogeographic studies, spanning more than
              700 species. It generalizes our findings, showing that separate
              biogeographic theories for countryside and island ecosystems are
              necessary. A theory of countryside biogeography is essential to
              conservation strategy in the agricultural ecosystems that
              comprise roughly half of the global land surface and are likely
              to increase even further.",

               challenge. We show that extinction estimates based on
               endemics-area and backward species-area relationships are
               complementary, and the crucial difference comprises the geometry
               of area loss. Across three taxa on four continents, the relative
               loss of species, and of phylogenetic and functional diversity,
               is highest when habitable area disappears inward from the edge
               of a region, lower when it disappears from the centre outwards,
               and lowest when area is lost at random. In inward destruction,
               species loss is almost proportional to area loss, although the
               decline in phylogenetic and functional diversity is less severe.
               These trends are explained by the geometry of species ranges and
               the shape of phylogenetic and functional trees, which may allow

              LandSAT imagery for regional to country-wide mapping of woody
              canopy cover. However, previous research has shown that L-band
              Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides good performance at
              retrieving woody canopy cover in southern African savannahs. This
              study's objective was to evaluate, compare and use in combination
              L-band ALOS PALSAR and LandSAT-5 TM, in a Random Forest
              environment, to assess the benefits of using LandSAT compared to
              ALOS PALSAR. Additional objectives saw the testing of LandSAT-5
              image seasonality, spectral vegetation indices and image textures
              for improved CC modelling. Results showed that LandSAT-5 imagery
              acquired in the summer and autumn seasons yielded the highest
              single season modelling accuracies (R2 between 0.47 and 0.65),
              depending on the year but the combination of multi-seasonal
              images yielded higher accuracies (R2 between 0.57 and 0.72). The
              derivation of spectral vegetation indices and image textures and
              their combinations with optical reflectance bands provided
              minimal improvement with no optical-only result exceeding the
              winter SAR L-band backscatter alone results (R2 of ∼0.8). The
              integration of seasonally appropriate LandSAT-5 image reflectance
              and L-band HH and HV backscatter data does provide a significant
              improvement for CC modelling at the higher end of the model
              performance (R2 between 0.83 and 0.88), but we conclude that
              L-band only based CC modelling be recommended for South African

              utility of using NDVI-derived phenology to detect change is often
              limited by poor quality data resulting from atmospheric and other
              effects. Here, we present a curve fitting methodology useful for
              time series of remotely sensed data that is minimally affected by
              atmospheric and sensor effects and requires neither spatial nor
              temporal averaging. A two-step technique is employed: first, a
              harmonic approach models the average annual phenology; second, a
              spline-based approach models inter-annual phenology. The
              principal attributes of the time series (e.g., amplitude, timing
              of onset of greenness, intrinsic smoothness or roughness) are
              captured while the effects of data drop-outs and gaps are
              minimized. A recursive, least squares approach captures the upper
              envelope of NDVI values by upweighting data values above an
              average annual curve. We test this methodology on several land
              cover types in the western U.S., and find that onset of greenness
              in an average year varied by less than 8 days within land cover
              types, indicating that the curve fit is consistent within similar
              systems. Between 1990 and 2002, temporal variability in onset of
              greenness was between 17 and 35 days depending on the land cover
              type, indicating that the inter-annual curve fit captures
              substantial inter-annual variability. Employing this curve
              fitting procedure enhances our ability to measure inter-annual

              farmland can support biodiversity through preservation of
              important ecosystem elements at a fine scale. However, how much
              biodiversity can be sustained and with what tradeoffs for
              production are open questions. Using a well-studied tropical
              ecosystem in Costa Rica, we develop an empirically based model
              for quantifying the ``wildlife-friendliness'' of farmland for
              native birds. Some 80\% of the 166 mist-netted species depend on
              fine-scale countryside forest elements ($\leq$ 60-m-wide clusters

              through farmland along hilltops, valleys, rivers, roads, and

              on farms nearly double the effective size of the local forest

              approaches to biodiversity monitoring have made significant steps
              forward to quantify and evaluate BD at many scales but still,
              these methods are limited to comparatively small areas. Earth
              observation (EO) techniques may provide a solution to overcome
              this shortcoming by measuring entities of interest at different
              spatial and temporal scales. This paper provides a comprehensive
              overview of the role of EO to detect, describe, explain, predict
              and assess biodiversity. Here, we focus on three main aspects
              related to biodiversity − taxonomic diversity, functional
              diversity and structural diversity, which integrate different
              levels of organization − molecular, genetic, individual, species,
              populations, communities, biomes, ecosystems and landscapes. In
              particular, we discuss the recording of taxonomic elements of
              biodiversity through the identification of animal and plant
              species. We highlight the importance of the spectral traits (ST)
              and spectral trait variations (STV) concept for EO-based
              biodiversity research. Furthermore we provide examples of
              spectral traits/spectral trait variations used in EO applications
              for quantifying taxonomic diversity, functional diversity and
              structural diversity. We discuss the use of EO to monitor
              biodiversity and habitat quality using different remote-sensing
              techniques. Finally, we suggest specifically important steps for
              a better integration of EO in biodiversity research. EO methods
              represent an affordable, repeatable and comparable method for
              measuring, describing, explaining and modelling taxonomic,
              functional and structural diversity. Upcoming sensor developments
              will provide opportunities to quantify spectral traits, currently
              not detectable with EO, and will surely help to describe
              biodiversity in more detail. Therefore, new concepts are needed
              to tightly integrate EO sensor networks with the identification
              of biodiversity. This will mean taking completely new directions

               the Xishuangbanna region of southwest China using
               phenology-based vegetation index differencing. Temporal profiles
               of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced
               Vegetation Index (EVI), Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation
               Index (ARVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), and
               Tasselled Cap Greenness (TCG) for rubber trees, natural forests
               and croplands were constructed using 11 Landsat 8 OLI images
               acquired within one year. These vegetation index time series
               accurately demonstrated the unique seasonal phenological
               dynamics of rubber trees. Two distinct phenological phases
               (i.e., defoliation and foliation) of rubber trees were clearly
               distinguishable from natural forests and croplands. Rubber trees
               undergo a brief defoliation-foliation process between late
               December and mid-March. Therefore, vegetation index differencing
               between the nearly complete defoliation (leaf-off) and full
               foliation (leaf flushing) phases was used to delineate rubber
               plantations within fragmented tropical mountainous landscapes.
               The method presented herein greatly improved rubber plantation
               classification accuracy. Overall classification accuracies
               derived from the differences of the five vegetation indices
               varied from 92\% to 96\% with corresponding kappa coefficients
               of 0.84--0.92. These results demonstrate the promising potential
               of phenology-based vegetation index differencing for mapping and

               model-based (GCM) output grids can bias the area identified as

               GCM outputs, typically at least 50x50 km, are biologically

               equally well portrayed in SDMs operating on base data of
               different grid sizes by comparing SDM performance statistics and
               area selected by four SDMs run at seven grid sizes, for nine

               biogeographic zones, Bolivia has extraordinary potential to
               develop a monitoring strategy aligned with the objectives of the
               Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network
               (GEO BON). Bolivia, a GEO Observer since 2005, is already
               working on the adequacy of national earth observations towards
               the objectives of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems
               (GEOSS). However, biodiversity is still an underrepresented
               component in this initiative. The integration of biodiversity
               into Bolivia?s GEO framework would confirm the need for a
               country level biodiversity monitoring strategy, fundamental to
               assess the progress towards the 2020 Aichi targets. Here we
               analyse and discuss two aspects of the process of developing
               such a strategy: (1) identification of taxonomic, temporal and
               spatial coverage of biodiversity data to detect both
               availability and gaps; and (2) evaluation of issues related to
               the acquisition, integration and analyses of multi-scale and
               multi-temporal biodiversity datasets. Our efforts resulted in
               the most comprehensive biodiversity database for the country of
               Bolivia, containing 648,534 records for 27,534 species
               referenced in time and space that account for 92.5\% of the
               species previously reported for the country. We capitalise this
               information into recommendations for the implementation of the
               Bolivian Biodiversity Observation Network that will help ensure
               that biodiversity is sustained as the country continues on its

  abstract  = "The study of the relative roles of local and regional processes
               in determining the scaling of species diversity is a very active
               field in current ecology. The importance of species turnover and
               the species?range?size frequency distributions in determining
               how local and regional species diversity are linked has been
               recognised by recent approaches. Here we present a model, based
               on a system of fully nested sampling quadrats, to analyse
               species diversity at several scales. Using a recursive procedure
               that incorporates increasingly smaller scales and a
               multiplicative formula for relating local and regional
               diversity, the model allows the simultaneous depiction of alpha,
               beta and gamma diversity in a single ?species?scale plot?.
               Species diversity is defined as the number of ranges that are
               intersected by sampling quadrats of various sizes. The size,
               shape and location of individual species ranges determine
               diversity at any scale, but the average point diversity,
               measured at hypothetical zero?area localities, is determined
               solely by the size of individual ranges, regardless of their
               shape and location. The model predicts that if the species?area
               relationship is a power function, then beta diversity must be
               scale invariant if measured at constant scale increments.
               Applying the model to the mammal fauna of four Mexican regions
               with contrasting environmental conditions, we found that: 1) the
               species?range?size frequency distribution at the scale of the
               Mexican regions differs from the log?normal pattern reported for
               the national and continental scales. 2) Beta diversity is not
               scale?invariant within each region, implying that the
               species?area relationship (SAR) does not follow a power
               function. 3) There is geographic variation in beta diversity. 4)
               The scaling of diversity is directly linked to patterns of
               species turnover rate, and ultimately determined by patterns in
               the geographic distribution of species. The model shows that
               regional species diversity and the average distribution range of
               species are the two basic data necessary to predict patterns in
               the scaling of species diversity.",

  abstract  = "The rapid disruption of tropical forests probably imperils
               global biodiversity more than any other contemporary phenomenon.
               With deforestation advancing quickly, protected areas are
               increasingly becoming final refuges for threatened species and
               natural ecosystem processes. However, many protected areas in
               the tropics are themselves vulnerable to human encroachment and
               other environmental stresses. As pressures mount, it is vital to
               know whether existing reserves can sustain their biodiversity. A
               critical constraint in addressing this question has been that
               data describing a broad array of biodiversity groups have been
               unavailable for a sufficiently large and representative sample
               of reserves. Here we present a uniquely comprehensive data set
               on changes over the past 20 to 30 years in 31 functional groups
               of species and 21 potential drivers of environmental change, for
               60 protected areas stratified across the world's major tropical
               regions. Our analysis reveals great variation in reserve
               `health': about half of all reserves have been effective or
               performed passably, but the rest are experiencing an erosion of
               biodiversity that is often alarmingly widespread taxonomically
               and functionally. Habitat disruption, hunting and forest-product
               exploitation were the strongest predictors of declining reserve
               health. Crucially, environmental changes immediately outside
               reserves seemed nearly as important as those inside in
               determining their ecological fate, with changes inside reserves
               strongly mirroring those occurring around them. These findings
               suggest that tropical protected areas are often intimately
               linked ecologically to their surrounding habitats, and that a
               failure to stem broad-scale loss and degradation of such
               habitats could sharply increase the likelihood of serious
               biodiversity declines.",

               identify their spatial patterns. Ecological data are usually
               characterized by spatial structures and as such, they are said
               to be spatially autocorrelated. Spatial autocorrelation refers
               to the pattern where the values of a quantitative variable are
               more similar at nearby locations than expected by chance alone.
               Most ecological data exhibit some degree of spatial
               autocorrelation that is modulated by the spatial sampling design
               used to record the data and the method used to analyze them.
               Furthermore, ecological data can be the end result of several
               processes operating at different spatial scales. In such cases,
               ecological data are a composite of large-scale trends at the
               macroscale, gradients and patchiness at mesoscale, and random
               patterns at local and microscales. Hence, to estimate the

              show that when sampling is standardised by area (species density)

              sizes depend critically on the spatial grain and extent of

              We set out to identify individuals of three focal canopy tree

              Barro Colorado Island, Panama, using airborne imaging
              spectroscopy data. First, we compared two leading single-class
              classification methods--binary support vector machine (SVM) and
              biased SVM--for their performance in identifying pixels of a
              single focal species. From this comparison we determined that
              biased SVM was more precise and created a multi-species
              classification model by combining the three biased SVM models.
              This model was applied to the imagery to identify pixels
              belonging to the three focal species and the prediction results
              were then processed to create a map of focal species crown
              objects. Crown-level cross-validation of the training data

              pixel-level producer's accuracies of 94-97\% for the three focal
              species, and field validation of the predicted crown objects
              indicated that these had user's accuracies of 94-100\%. Our

              surrounding host landscapes. We uncovered substantial mean biases
              (9-98\%) in forest canopy structure (height, gaps, and layers)
              and aboveground biomass in both lowland Amazonian and montane
              Andean landscapes. Moreover, simulations reveal that an
              impractical number of 1-ha field plots (from 10 to more than 100
              per landscape) are needed to develop accurate estimates of
              aboveground biomass at landscape scales. These biases should
              temper the use of plots for extrapolations of forest dynamics to
              larger scales, and they demonstrate the need for a fundamental
              shift to high-resolution active remote sensing techniques as a
              primary sampling tool in tropical forest biomass studies. The
              potential decrease in the bias and uncertainty of remotely sensed

              outcomes are sensitive to initial assumptions, inputs, and
              modeling methods Selection of predictor variables, a central step
              in modeling, is one of the areas where different techniques can
              yield varying results. Selection of climate variables to use as
              predictors is often done using statistical approaches that
              develop correlations between occurrences and climate data. These
              approaches have received criticism in that they rely on the
              statistical properties of the data rather than directly
              incorporating biological information about species responses to
              temperature and precipitation. We evaluated and compared models
              and prediction maps for 15 threatened or endangered species in
              Florida based on two variable selection techniques: expert
              opinion and a statistical method. We compared model performance
              between these two approaches for contemporary predictions, and
              the spatial correlation, spatial overlap and area predicted for
              contemporary and future climate predictions. In general, experts
              identified more variables as being important than the statistical
              method and there was low overlap in the variable sets (0.9 for
              area under the curve (AUC) and >0.7 for true skill statistic
              (TSS). Spatial overlap, which compares the spatial configuration
              between maps constructed using the different variable selection
              techniques, was only moderate overall (about 60\%), with a great
              deal of variability across species. Difference in spatial overlap
              was even greater under future climate projections, indicating
              additional divergence of model outputs from different variable
              selection techniques. Our work is in agreement with other studies
              which have found that for broad-scale species distribution
              modeling, using statistical methods of variable selection is a
              useful first step, especially when there is a need to model a
              large number of species or expert knowledge of the species is
              limited. Expert input can then be used to refine models that seem
              unrealistic or for species that experts believe are particularly
              sensitive to change. It also emphasizes the importance of using
              multiple models to reduce uncertainty and improve map outputs for
              conservation planning. Where outputs overlap or show the same
              direction of change there is greater certainty in the
              predictions. Areas of disagreement can be used for learning by
              asking why the models do not agree, and may highlight areas where
              additional on-the-ground data collection could improve the

              selecting relevant traits; (ii) describing intraspecific trait
              variation and incorporating this variation into models; and (iii)
              scaling trait data to community- and ecosystem-level processes.

  abstract  = "Leaf pigment content can provide valuable insight into the
               physiological performance of leaves. Measurement of spectral
               reflectance provides a fast, nondestructive method for pigment
               estimation. A large number of spectral indices have been
               developed for estimation of leaf pigment content. However, in
               most cases these indices have been tested for only one or at
               most a few related species and thus it is not clear whether they
               can be applied across species with varying leaf structural
               characteristics. Our objective in this study was to develop
               spectral indices for prediction of leaf pigment content that are
               relatively insensitive to species and leaf structure variation
               and thus could be applied in larger scale remote-sensing studies
               without extensive calibration. We also quantified the degree of
               spectral interference between pigments when multiple pigments
               occur within the same leaf tissue. We found that previously
               published spectral indices provided relatively poor correlations
               with leaf chlorophyll content when applied across a wide range
               of species and plant functional types. Leaf surface reflectance
               appeared to be the most important factor in this variation. By
               developing a new spectral index that reduces the effect of
               differences in leaf surface reflectance, we were able to
               significantly improve the correlations with chlorophyll content.
               We also found that an index based on the first derivative of
               reflectance in the red edge region was insensitive to leaf
               structural variation. The presence of other pigments did not
               significantly affect estimation of chlorophyll from spectral
               reflectance. Previously published carotenoid and anthocyanin
               indices performed poorly across the whole data set. However, we
               found that the photochemical reflectance index (PRI, originally
               developed for estimation of xanthophyll cycle pigment changes)
               was related to carotenoid/chlorophyll ratios in green leaves.
               This result has important implications for the interpretation of
               PRI measured at both large and small scales. Our results
               demonstrate that spectral indices can be applied across species
               with widely varying leaf structure without the necessity for

               (species turnover) and the decay of community similarity with
               distance depend on spatial resolution (grain). We also study
               whether patterns of beta diversity are related to variability in
               climate, land cover or geographic distance and how the
               independent effects of these variables depend on the spatial
               grain of the data. Location? Europe, Great Britain, Finland and
               Catalonia. Methods? We used data on European birds, plants,
               butterflies, amphibians and reptiles, and data on British
               plants, Catalonian birds and Finnish butterflies. We fitted two
               or three nested grids of varying resolutions to each of these
               datasets. For each grid we calculated differences in climate,
               differences in land?cover composition (CORINE) and beta
               diversity (?sim, ?Jaccard) between all pairs of grid cells. In a
               separate analysis we looked specifically at pairs of adjacent
               grid cells (the first distance class). We then used variation
               partitioning to identify the magnitude of independent
               statistical associations (i.e. independent effects in the
               statistical sense) of climate, land cover and geographic
               distance with spatial patterns of beta diversity. Results? Beta
               diversity between grid cells at any given distance decreased
               with increasing grain. Geographic distance was always the most
               important predictor of beta diversity for all pairwise
               comparisons at the extent of Europe. Climate and land cover had
               weaker but distinct and grain?dependent effects. Climate was
               more important at relatively coarse grains, whereas land?cover
               effects were stronger at finer grains. In the country?wide
               analyses, climate and land cover were more important than
               geographic distance. Climatic and land?cover models performed
               poorly and showed no systematic grain dependence for beta
               diversity between adjacent grid cells. Main conclusions? We
               found that relationships between geographic distance and beta
               diversity, as well as the environmental correlates of beta
               diversity, are systematically grain dependent. The strong
               independent effect of distance indicates that, contrary to the
               current belief, a substantial fraction of species are missing
               from areas with a suitable environment. Moreover, the effects of
               geographic distance (at continental extents) and land cover (at
               fine grains) indicate that any species distribution modelling
               should take both environment and dispersal limitation into

               resolutions, together with an increasing number of digitized and
               georeferenced species occurrences, has created the opportunity
               to model and monitor species geographic distribution and
               richness at regional to continental scales. In this paper, we
               examine the application of recently developed global data
               products from satellite observations in modeling the potential
               distribution of tree species and diversity in the Amazon basin.
               We use data from satellite sensors, including MODIS, QSCAT,
               SRTM, and TRMM, to develop different environmental variables
               related to vegetation, landscape, and climate. These variables
               are used in a maximum entropy method (Maxent) to model the
               geographical distribution of five commercial trees and to
               classify the patterns of tree alpha-diversity in the Amazon
               basin. Maxent simulations are analyzed using binomial tests of
               omission rates and the area under the receiver operating
               characteristics (ROC) curves to examine the model performance,
               the accuracy of geographic distributions, and the significance
               of environmental variables for discriminating suitable habitats.
               To evaluate the importance of satellite data, we used the Maxent
               jackknife test to quantify the training gains from data layers
               and to compare the results with model simulations using
               climate-only data. For all species and tree alpha-diversity,
               modeled distributions are in agreement with historical data and
               field observations. The results compare with climate-derived
               patterns, but provide better spatial resolution and detailed
               information on the habitat characteristics. Among satellite data
               products, QSCAT backscatter, representing canopy moisture and
               roughness, and MODIS leaf area index (LAI) are the most
               important variables in almost all cases. Model simulations
               suggest that climate and remote sensing results are

  abstract  = "Abstract The amount and spatial distribution of forest biomass
               in the Amazon basin is a major source of uncertainty in
               estimating the flux of carbon released from land?cover and
               land?use change. Direct measurements of aboveground live biomass
               (AGLB) are limited to small areas of forest inventory plots and
               site?specific allometric equations that cannot be readily
               generalized for the entire basin. Furthermore, there is no
               spaceborne remote sensing instrument that can measure tropical
               forest biomass directly. To determine the spatial distribution
               of forest biomass of the Amazon basin, we report a method based
               on remote sensing metrics representing various forest structural
               parameters and environmental variables, and more than 500 plot
               measurements of forest biomass distributed over the basin. A
               decision tree approach was used to develop the spatial
               distribution of AGLB for seven distinct biomass classes of
               lowland old?growth forests with more than 80\% accuracy. AGLB
               for other vegetation types, such as the woody and herbaceous
               savanna and secondary forests, was directly estimated with a
               regression based on satellite data. Results show that AGLB is
               highest in Central Amazonia and in regions to the east and
               north, including the Guyanas. Biomass is generally above
               300?Mg?ha?1 here except in areas of intense logging or open
               floodplains. In Western Amazonia, from the lowlands of Peru,
               Ecuador, and Colombia to the Andean mountains, biomass ranges
               from 150 to 300?Mg?ha?1. Most transitional and seasonal forests
               at the southern and northwestern edges of the basin have biomass
               ranging from 100 to 200?Mg?ha?1. The AGLB distribution has a
               significant correlation with the length of the dry season. We
               estimate that the total carbon in forest biomass of the Amazon
               basin, including the dead and belowground biomass, is 86?Pg?C

  abstract  = "ABSTRACT Knowledge about biodiversity remains inadequate because
               most species living on Earth were still not formally described
               (the Linnean shortfall) and because geographical distributions
               of most species are poorly understood and usually contain many
               gaps (the Wallacean shortfall). In this paper, we developed
               models to infer the size and placement of geographical ranges of
               hypothetical non?described species, based on the range size
               frequency distribution of anurans recently described in the
               Cerrado Biome, on the level of knowledge (number of inventories)
               and on surrogates for habitat suitability. The rationale for
               these models is as follow: (1) the range size frequency
               distribution of these species should be similar to the
               range?restricted species, which have been most recently
               described in the Cerrado Biome; (2) the probability of new
               discoveries will increase in areas with low biodiversity
               knowledge, mainly in suitable areas, and (3) assuming range
               continuity, new species should occupy adjacent cells only if the
               level of knowledge is low enough to allow the existence of
               undiscovered species. We ran a model based on the number of
               inventories only, and two models combining effects of number of
               inventories and two different estimates of habitat suitability,
               for a total of 100 replicates each. Finally, we performed a
               complementary analysis using simulated annealing to solve the
               set?covering problem for each simulation (i.e. finding the
               smallest number of cells so that all species are represented at
               least once), using extents of occurrence of 160 species (131
               real anuran species plus 29 new simulated species). The revised
               reserve system that included information about unknown or poorly
               sampled taxa significantly shifted northwards, when compared to
               a system based on currently known species. This main result can
               be explained by the paucity of biodiversity data in this part of
               the biome, associated with its relatively high habitat
               suitability. As a precautionary measure, weighted by the
               inferred distribution data, the prioritization of a system of
               reserves in the north part of the biome appears to be
               defensible.",

               significant advances in land-cover classifications by combining
               data from multi-passive and active sensors, and new
               classification techniques. Species distribution modelling has

              with specific events or processes. Landsat images constitute a
              major data source for habitat monitoring, capturing broad scale
              information on changes in habitat extent and spatial patterns of
              fragmentation that allow disturbances in protected areas to be
              identified. These data are, however, less able to provide
              information on changes in habitat quality, species distribution
              and fine-scale disturbances, and hence data from other spaceborne
              optical sensors are increasingly being considered. Very High
              Resolution (VHR) optical datasets have been exploited to a lesser
              extent, partly because of the relative recency of spaceborne
              observations and challenges associated with obtaining and
              routinely extracting information from airborne multi-spectral and
              hyperspectral datasets. The lack of a shortwave infrared band in
              many VHR datasets and provision of too much detail (e.g., shadows
              within and from landscape objects) also present challenges in
              some cases. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Synthetic

                assessment, NASA has proposed the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager
                (HyspIRI) imaging spectrometer, which measures the randiance
                380-2500nm in 10nm contiguous bands with 60m ground sample
                distance (GSD). However, because of the large pixel size on the

                structure on observed radiance. This research evaluates
                linkages between vegetation structure and imaging spectroscopy.
                Specifically, we assess the impact of within-pixel vegetation
                density and position on large-footprint spectral radiances. To
                achieve this objective, three virtual forest scenes were

                structure of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)
                Pacific Southwest domain (PSW; D17; Fresno, CA). These were

                verify the geometric parameters and physical models. Multiple
                simulated HyspIRI data sets were generated by varying
                within-pixel structural variables, such as forest density,
                position, and distribution of trees, in order to assess the
                impact of sub-pixel structural variation on observed HyspIRI
                data. Results indicate that HyspIRI is sensitive to sub-pixel

               from presence?only species records. This paper is written for
               ecologists and describes the MaxEnt model from a statistical
               perspective, making explicit links between the structure of the
               model, decisions required in producing a modelled distribution,
               and knowledge about the species and the data that might affect
               those decisions. To begin we discuss the characteristics of
               presence?only data, highlighting implications for modelling
               distributions. We particularly focus on the problems of sample
               bias and lack of information on species prevalence. The keystone
               of the paper is a new statistical explanation of MaxEnt which
               shows that the model minimizes the relative entropy between two
               probability densities (one estimated from the presence data and
               one, from the landscape) defined in covariate space. For many
               users, this viewpoint is likely to be a more accessible way to
               understand the model than previous ones that rely on machine
               learning concepts. We then step through a detailed explanation
               of MaxEnt describing key components (e.g. covariates and
               features, and definition of the landscape extent), the mechanics
               of model fitting (e.g. feature selection, constraints and
               regularization) and outputs. Using case studies for a Banksia

               composition of breeding birds and resident butterflies in the
               Great Basin of North America depended on sampling grain (the
               smallest resolvable unit of study) and on the relative proximity
               of sampling units across the landscape. We also compared
               patterns between the two taxonomic groups with reference to
               their life?history characteristics. Location? Data for our
               analyses were collected from 1996 to 2003 in three adjacent
               mountain ranges in the central Great Basin (Lander and Nye
               counties, Nevada, USA): the Shoshone Mountains, Toiyabe Range
               and Toquima Range. Methods? Data on species composition for both
               taxonomic groups were collecting using standard inventory
               methods for birds and butterflies in temperate regions. Data
               were compiled at three sampling grains, sites (average 12?ha),
               canyons (average 74?ha) and mountain ranges. For each sampling
               grain in turn, we calculated similarity of species composition
               using the Jaccard index. First, we investigated whether mean
               similarity of species composition among the three ranges
               differed as a function of the grain size at which data were
               compiled. Secondly, we explored whether mean similarity of
               species composition was greater for canyons within the same
               mountain range than for canyons within different mountain
               ranges. Thirdly, we examined whether mean similarity of species
               composition at the site level was different for sites within the
               same canyon, sites within different canyons in the same mountain
               range, and sites within canyons in different mountain ranges. We
               used a Bayesian model to analyse these comparisons. Results? For
               both taxonomic groups, mean similarity of species composition
               increased as the sampling grain increased. The effect of spatial
               grain was somewhat greater for birds than for butterflies,
               especially when the intermediate sampling grain was compared
               with the smallest sampling grain. Similarity of species
               composition of butterflies at each sampling grain was greater
               than similarity of species composition of birds at the same
               grain. Mean similarity of species composition of both birds and
               butterflies at the canyon level and site level was affected by
               relative proximity of sampling locations; beta diversity
               increased as the relative isolation of sampling locations
               increased. Main conclusions? The sensitivity of beta diversity
               to sampling grain likely reflects the effect of local
               environmental heterogeneity: as sampling grain increases, biotic
               assemblages appear more homogeneous. Although breeding birds in
               our study system have larger home ranges than resident
               butterflies, birds may have more specialized resource
               requirements related to vegetation structure and composition,
               especially at small sampling scales. The degree of variation in
               species composition of both taxonomic groups suggests that
               spatially extensive sampling will be more effective for drawing
               inferences about regional patterns of species diversity than
               intensive sampling at relatively few, smaller sites.",

              ecology. The global biodiversity information facility (GBIF), a
              portal that collates digitized collection and survey data, is the
              largest online provider of distribution records. However, all
              distributional databases are spatially biassed due to uneven
              effort of sampling, data storage and mobilization. Such bias is
              particularly pronounced in GBIF, where nation-wide differences in
              funding and data sharing lead to huge differences in contribution
              to GBIF. We use a common Eurasian butterfly (Aglais urticae) as
              an exemplar taxon to provide evidence that range model quality is
              decreasing due to the spatial clustering of distributional
              records in GBIF. Furthermore, we show that such loss of model
              quality would go unnoticed with standard methods of model quality
              evaluation. Using evaluations of model predictions of the Swiss
              distribution of the species, we compare distribution models of
              full data with data where a subsampling procedure removes spatial
              bias at the cost of record numbers, but not of spatial extent of
              records. We show that data with less spatial bias produce better
              predictive models even though they are based on less input data.
              Our subsampling routine may therefore be a suitable method to
              reduce the impact of spatial bias to species distribution models.
              Our results warn of automatized applications of species
              distribution models to distributional databases (as has been
              advocated and implemented), as internal model evaluation did not
              show the decline of model quality with increased spatial bias

              biodiversity loss require robust data and a diverse indicator set
              to monitor and report on biodiversity trends. Gaps in data
              availability and narrow?based indicator sets are significant
              information barriers to fulfilling these needs. In this paper,
              the reporting requirements of seven global or European
              biodiversity policy instruments were reviewed using the list of
              Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) as an analytical
              framework. The reporting requirements for the most comprehensive
              policy instrument, the United Nation's Strategic Plan for
              Biodiversity 2011?2020, were compared with the indicator set
              actually used for its reporting, to identify current information
              gaps. To explore the extent to which identified gaps could be
              bridged, the potential contribution of data mobilization,
              modelling and further processing of existing data was assessed.
              The information gaps identified demonstrate that decision?makers
              are currently constrained by the lack of data and indicators on
              changes in the EBV classes Genetic Composition and, to a lesser
              extent, Species Populations for which data is most often
              available. Furthermore, the results show that even when there is
              a requirement for specific information for reporting, the
              indicators used may not be able to provide all the information,
              for example current Convention of Biological Diversity indicators
              provide relatively little information on changes in the Ecosystem
              Function and Ecosystem Structure classes. This gap could be
              partly closed by using existing indicators as proxies, whereas
              additional indicators may be computed based on available data
              (e.g. for EBVs in the Ecosystem Structure class). However, for
              the EBV class Genetic Composition, no immediate improvement based
              on proxies or existing data seems possible. Synthesis and
              applications. Using Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) as a
              tool, theory?driven comparisons could be made between the
              biodiversity information gaps in reporting and indicator sets.
              Analytical properties, such as an identification of which data
              and indicator(s) are relevant per EBV, will need to be addressed
              before EBVs can actually become operational and facilitate the
              integration of data flows for monitoring and reporting. In the
              meantime, a first analysis shows that existing indicators and

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Tropical forests provide a crucial carbon sink for a
               sizable portion of annual global CO2 emissions. Policies that
               incentivize tropical forest conservation by monetizing forest
               carbon ultimately depend on accurate estimates of national
               carbon stocks, which are often based on field inventory
               sampling. As an exercise to understand the limitations of field
               inventory sampling, we tested whether two common field-plot
               sampling approaches could accurately estimate carbon stocks
               across approximately 76 million ha of Per{\'u}vian forests. A
               1-ha resolution LiDAR-based map of carbon stocks was used as a
               model of the country's carbon geography. RESULTS: Both field
               inventory sampling approaches worked well in estimating total
               national carbon stocks, almost always falling within 10 \% of
               the model national total. However, the sampling approaches were
               unable to produce accurate spatially-explicit estimates of the
               carbon geography of Per{\'u}, with estimates falling within 10
               \% of the model carbon geography across no more than 44 \% of
               the country. We did not find any associations between carbon
               stock errors from the field plot estimates and six different
               environmental variables. CONCLUSIONS: Field inventory plot
               sampling does not provide accurate carbon geography for a
               tropical country with wide ranging environmental gradients such
               as Per{\'u}. The lack of association between estimated carbon
               errors and environmental variables suggests field inventory
               sampling results from other nations would not differ from those
               reported here. Tropical forest nations should understand the
               risks associated with primarily field-based sampling approaches,
               and consider alternatives leading to more effective forest

               theory of species diversity: Towards a general theory of
               diversity",
  author    = "Whittaker, Robert J and Willis, Katherine J and Field, Richard",
  abstract  = "Aim Current weaknesses of diversity theory include: a failure to
               distinguish different biogeographical response variables under
               the general heading of diversity; and a general failure of
               ecological theory to deal adequately with geographical scale.
               Our aim is to articulate the case for a top?down approach to
               theory building, in which scale is addressed explicitly and in
               which different response variables are clearly distinguished.
               Location The article draws upon both theoretical contributions
               and empirical analyses from all latitudes, focusing on
               terrestrial ecosystems and with some bias towards (woody)
               plants. Methods We review current diversity theory and
               terminology in relation to scale of applicability. As a starting
               point in developing a general theory, we take the issue of
               geographical gradients in species richness as a main theme and
               evaluate the extent to which commonly cited theories are likely
               to operate at scales from the macro down to the local. Results A
               degree of confusion surrounds the use of the terms alpha, beta
               and gamma diversity, and the terms local, landscape and
               macro?scale are preferred here as a more intuitive framework.
               The distinction between inventory and differentiation diversity
               is highlighted as important as, in terms of scale of analysis,
               are the concepts of focus and extent. The importance of holding
               area constant in analysis is stressed, as is the notion that
               different environmental factors exhibit measurable heterogeneity
               at different scales. Evaluation of several of the most common
               diversity theories put forward for the grand clines in species
               richness, indicates that they can be collapsed to dynamic
               hypotheses based on climate or historical explanations. The
               importance of the many ecological/biological mechanisms that
               have been proposed is evident mainly at local scales of
               analysis, whilst at the macro?scale they are dependent largely
               upon climatic controls for their operation. Local communities
               have often been found not to be saturated, i.e. to be
               non?equilibrial. This is argued, perhaps counter?intuitively, to
               be entirely compatible with the persistence through time of
               macro?scale patterns of richness that are climatically
               determined. The review also incorporates recent developments in
               macroecology, Rapoport?s rule, trade?offs, and the importance of
               isolation, landscape impedance and geometric constraints on
               richness (the mid?domain effect) in generating richness
               patterns; highlighting those phenomena that are contributory to
               the first?order climatic pattern, and those, such as the
               geometric constraints, that may confound or obscure these
               patterns. Main conclusions A general theory of diversity must
               necessarily cover many disparate phenomena, at various scales of
               analysis, and cannot therefore be expressed in a simple formula,
               but individual elements of this general theory may be. In
               particular, it appears possible to capture in a dynamic
               climate?based model and ?capacity rule?, the form of the grand
               cline in richness of woody plants at the macro?scale. This
               provides a starting point for a top?down, global?to?local,
               macro?to?micro scale approach to modelling richness variations
               in a variety of taxa. Patterns in differentiation/endemicity, on
               the other hand, require more immediate attention to historical
               events, and to features of geography such as isolation. Thus,
               whilst we argue that there are basic physical principles and
               laws underlying certain diversity phenomena (e.g. macro?scale
               richness gradients), a pluralistic body of theory is required
               that incorporates dynamic and historical explanation, and which
               bridges equilibrial and nonequilibrial concepts and ideas.",

               delineated sunlit regions of tree crowns. The overall accuracy
               for classifying 10 tree species was around 82\% (8 bands,
               object-based). The class-specific producer's accuracies ranged
               between 33\% (European hornbeam) and 94\% (European beech) and
               the user's accuracies between 57\% (European hornbeam) and 92\%
               (Lawson's cypress). The object-based approach outperformed the
               pixel-based approach. We could show that the 4 new WorldView-2
               bands (Coastal, Yellow, Red Edge, and Near Infrared 2) have only
               limited impact on classification accuracy if only the 4 main
               tree species (Norway spruce, Scots pine, European beech, and

               accuracy increased significantly using the full spectral

               impact on overall classification accuracy, the importance of the

               An in-depth analysis of the RF output was carried out to
               evaluate the impact of reference data quality and the resulting
               reliability of final class assignments. Finally, an extensive

               sensing. This paper examines issues related to hyperspatial and

               the most potentially powerful yet underutilized sources of for
               tropical research on biodiversity. Hyperspatial data with their
               increased pixel resolution are possibly best suited at
               facilitating the accurate location of features such as tree
               canopies, but less suited to the identification of aspects such
               as species identity, particularly when spatial resolution
               becomes too fine and pixels are smaller than the size of the
               object (e.g., tree canopy) being identified. Hyperspectral data
               on the other hand, with their high spectral resolution, can be
               used to record information pertaining to a range of critical
               plant properties related to species identity, and can be very
               effective used for discriminating tree species in tropical

               There remains a glaring gap in the easy availability of

  abstract  = "Abstract Plant traits ? the morphological, anatomical,
               physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of
               plants and their organs ? determine how primary producers
               respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels,
               influence ecosystem processes and services and provide a link
               from species richness to ecosystem functional diversity. Trait
               data thus represent the raw material for a wide range of
               research from evolutionary biology, community and functional
               ecology to biogeography. Here we present the global database
               initiative named TRY, which has united a wide range of the plant
               trait research community worldwide and gained an unprecedented
               buy?in of trait data: so far 93 trait databases have been
               contributed. The data repository currently contains almost three
               million trait entries for 69?000 out of the world's 300?000
               plant species, with a focus on 52 groups of traits
               characterizing the vegetative and regeneration stages of the
               plant life cycle, including growth, dispersal, establishment and
               persistence. A first data analysis shows that most plant traits
               are approximately log?normally distributed, with widely
               differing ranges of variation across traits. Most trait
               variation is between species (interspecific), but significant
               intraspecific variation is also documented, up to 40\% of the
               overall variation. Plant functional types (PFTs), as commonly
               used in vegetation models, capture a substantial fraction of the
               observed variation ? but for several traits most variation
               occurs within PFTs, up to 75\% of the overall variation. In the
               context of vegetation models these traits would better be
               represented by state variables rather than fixed parameter
               values. The improved availability of plant trait data in the
               unified global database is expected to support a paradigm shift
               from species to trait?based ecology, offer new opportunities for
               synthetic plant trait research and enable a more realistic and

  abstract = "We propose a method for generating classifier ensembles based on
              feature extraction. To create the training data for a base
              classifier, the feature set is randomly split into K subsets (K
              is a parameter of the algorithm) and Principal Component Analysis
              (PCA) is applied to each subset. All principal components are
              retained in order to preserve the variability information in the
              data. Thus, K axis rotations take place to form the new features
              for a base classifier. The idea of the rotation approach is to
              encourage simultaneously individual accuracy and diversity within
              the ensemble. Diversity is promoted through the feature
              extraction for each base classifier. Decision trees were chosen
              here because they are sensitive to rotation of the feature axes,
              hence the name ``forest.'' Accuracy is sought by keeping all
              principal components and also using the whole data set to train
              each base classifier. Using WEKA, we examined the Rotation Forest
              ensemble on a random selection of 33 benchmark data sets from the
              UCI repository and compared it with Bagging, AdaBoost, and Random
              Forest. The results were favorable to Rotation Forest and
              prompted an investigation into diversity-accuracy landscape of
              the ensemble models. Diversity-error diagrams revealed that
              Rotation Forest ensembles construct individual classifiers which
              are more accurate than these in AdaBoost and Random Forest, and
              more diverse than these in Bagging, sometimes more accurate as

               The simulations were used to study the stability of recently
               proposed vegetation indices (VIs) derived from adjacent
               narrowband spectral reflectance data across the visible (VIS)

               The prediction power of these indices with respect to green leaf
               area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll density (CCD) was
               compared, and their sensitivity to canopy architecture,

               need of ways to improve collection efficiency based on
               quantitative evidence. Using imaging spectrometer data collected
               by the Carnegie Airborne Observatory for hundreds of
               field-identified tree crowns in Kruger National Park, South
               Africa, we developed woody plant species classification models

               increasing numbers of training crowns. First, we show that
               classification accuracy must be estimated while respecting the
               crown as the basic unit of data; otherwise, accuracy will be
               overestimated and the amount of training data needed to perform

  abstract = "Correlations between foliar nutrient concentrations and soil
              nutrient availability have been found in multiple ecosystems.
              These relationships have led to the use of foliar nutrients as an
              index of nutrient status and to the prediction of broadscale
              patterns in ecosystem processes. More recently, a growing
              interest in ecological stoichiometry has fueled multiple analyses
              of foliar nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) ratios within and across
              ecosystems. These studies have observed that N:P values are
              generally elevated in tropical forests when compared to higher
              latitude ecosystems, adding weight to a common belief that
              tropical forests are generally N rich and P poor. However, while
              these broad generalizations may have merit, their simplicity
              masks the enormous environmental heterogeneity that exists within
              the tropics; such variation includes large ranges in soil
              fertility and climate, as well as the highest plant species
              diversity of any biome. Here we present original data on foliar N
              and P concentrations from 150 mature canopy tree species in Costa
              Rica and Brazil, and combine those data with a comprehensive new
              literature synthesis to explore the major sources of variation in
              foliar N:P values within the tropics. We found no relationship
              between N:P ratios and either latitude or mean annual
              precipitation within the tropics alone. There is, however,
              evidence of seasonal controls; in our Costa Rica sites, foliar
              N:P values differed by 25\% between wet and dry seasons. The N:P
              ratios do vary with soil P availability and/or soil order, but
              there is substantial overlap across coarse divisions in soil
              type, and perhaps the most striking feature of the data set is
              variation at the species level. Taken as a whole, our results
              imply that the dominant influence on foliar N:P ratios in the
              tropics is species variability and that, unlike marine systems
              and perhaps many other terrestrial biomes, the N:P stoichiometry
              of tropical forests is not well constrained. Thus any use of N:P
              ratios in the tropics to infer larger-scale ecosystem processes
              must comprehensively account for the diversity of any given site
              and recognize the broad range in nutrient requirements, even at
              the local scale.",

               at landscape scales in tropical forests is a difficult task that
               could benefit from the recent development of satellite imaging
               spectroscopy. We tested an application of the EO?1 Hyperion
               satellite sensor to spectrally detect the location of five
               important tree taxa in the lowland humid tropical forests of
               southeastern Peru. Location: Peru, Departamento de Madre de
               D{\'\i}os. Methods: We used linear discriminant analysis with a
               stepwise selection procedure to analyze two Hyperion datasets
               (July and December 2006) to choose the most informative narrow
               bands for classifying trees. Results: Optimal channels selected
               were different between the two seasons. Classification was 100\%
               successful for the five taxa when using 25 narrow bands and
               pixels that represented >40\% of tree crowns. We applied the
               discriminant functions developed separately for the two seasons
               to the entire study area, and found significantly nonrandom
               overlap in the anticipated distributions of the five taxa

              biodiversity is under assault on a global basis and that species
              are being lost at a greatly enhanced rate. This article examines
              the role played by biogeographical science in the emergence of
              conservation guidance and makes the case for the recognition of
              Conservation Biogeography as a key subfield of conservation
              biology delimited as: the application of biogeographical
              principles, theories, and analyses, being those concerned with
              the distributional dynamics of taxa individually and
              collectively, to problems concerning the conservation of
              biodiversity. Conservation biogeography thus encompasses both a
              substantial body of theory and analysis, and some of the most
              prominent planning frameworks used in conservation. Considerable
              advances in conservation guidelines have been made over the last
              few decades by applying biogeographical methods and principles.
              Herein we provide a critical review focussed on the sensitivity
              to assumptions inherent in the applications we examine. In
              particular, we focus on four inter?related factors: (i) scale
              dependency (both spatial and temporal); (ii) inadequacies in
              taxonomic and distributional data (the so?called Linnean and
              Wallacean shortfalls); (iii) effects of model structure and
              parameterisation; and (iv) inadequacies of theory. These generic
              problems are illustrated by reference to studies ranging from the
              application of historical biogeography, through island
              biogeography, and complementarity analyses to bioclimatic
              envelope modelling. There is a great deal of uncertainty inherent
              in predictive analyses in conservation biogeography and this area
              in particular presents considerable challenges. ?Protected area
              planning frameworks and their resulting map outputs are amongst
              the most powerful and influential applications within
              conservation biogeography, and at the global scale are
              characterised by the production, by a small number of prominent
              NGOs, of bespoke schemes, which serve both to mobilise funds and
              channel efforts in a highly targeted fashion. We provide a simple
              typology of protected area planning frameworks, with particular
              reference to the global scale, and provide a brief critique of
              some of their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we discuss the
              importance, especially at regional scales, of developing more
              responsive analyses and models that integrate pattern (the
              compositionalist approach) and processes (the functionalist
              approach) such as range collapse and climate change, again noting
              the sensitivity of outcomes to starting assumptions. We make the
              case for the greater engagement of the biogeographical community
              in a programme of evaluation and refinement of all such schemes
              to test their robustness and their sensitivity to alternative

                 quantitative methods for tasks such as species identification
                 from remote sensing images. We ran a competition to help
                 improve three tasks that are central to converting images into
                 information on individual trees: 1) crown segmentation, for
                 identifying the location and size of individual trees; 2)
                 alignment, to match ground truthed trees with remote sensing;
                 and 3) species classification of individual trees. Six teams
                 (composed of 16 individual participants) submitted predictions
                 for one or more tasks. The crown segmentation task proved to
                 be the most challenging, with the highest-performing algorithm
                 yielding only 34\% overlap between remotely sensed crowns and
                 the ground truthed trees. However, most algorithms performed
                 better on larger trees. For the alignment task, an algorithm
                 based on minimizing the difference, in terms of both position
                 and tree size, between ground truthed and remotely sensed
                 crowns yielded a perfect alignment. In hindsight, this task
                 was over simplified by only including targeted trees instead
                 of all possible remotely sensed crowns. Several algorithms
                 performed well for species classification, with the
                 highest-performing algorithm correctly classifying 92\% of
                 individuals and performing well on both common and rare

              Although the basic properties of leaf spectra have been known for
              decades, interpreting canopy-level spectra is more challenging
              because leaf-level effects are complicated by a host of stem- and
              canopy-level traits. Progress has been made through empirical
              analyses and models, although both methods have been hampered by

              Here, we evaluated the performance of Random Forest in upscaling
              airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)-based carbon
              estimates compared to the stratification approach over a
              16-million hectare focal area of the Western Amazon. We
              considered two runs of Random Forest, both with and without
              spatial contextual modeling by including--in the latter case--x,
              and y position directly in the model. In each case, we set aside
              8 million hectares (i.e., half of the focal area) for validation;
              this rigorous test of Random Forest went above and beyond the
              internal validation normally compiled by the algorithm (i.e.,
              called ``out-of-bag''), which proved insufficient for this
              spatial application. In this heterogeneous region of Northern
              Peru, the model with spatial context was the best preforming run
              of Random Forest, and explained 59\% of LiDAR-based carbon
              estimates within the validation area, compared to 37\% for
              stratification or 43\% by Random Forest without spatial context.
              With the 60\% improvement in explained variation, RMSE against
              validation LiDAR samples improved from 33 to 26 Mg C ha(-1) when
              using Random Forest with spatial context. Our results suggest
              that spatial context should be considered when using Random
              Forest, and that doing so may result in substantially improved

              foliar \%N over a range of scales are needed to enhance
              understanding of terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycles. High
              spectral resolution aircraft remote sensing has become an
              increasingly common tool for landscape-scale estimates of canopy
              \%N because reflectance in some portions of the spectrum has been
              shown to correlate strongly with field-measured \%N. These
              patterns have been observed repeatedly over a wide range of
              biomes, opening new possibilities for planned Earth observation
              satellites. Nevertheless, the effects of spectral resolution and
              other sensor characteristics on \%N estimates have not been fully
              examined, and may have implications for future analyses at
              landscape, regional and global scales. In this study, we explored
              the effects of spectral resolution, spatial resolution and sensor
              fidelity on relationships between forest canopy \%N and
              reflectance measurements from airborne and satellite platforms.
              We conducted an exercise whereby PLS, simple and multiple
              regression calibrations to field-measured canopy \%N for a series
              of forested sites were iteratively performed using (1) high
              resolution data from AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging
              Spectrometer) that were degraded spectrally from 10nm to 30nm,
              50nm, 70nm, and 90nm bandwidths, and spatially from 18m to 30m
              and 60m pixels; (2) data representing Landsat and MODIS (Moderate
              Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) spectral bands simulated
              with data from AVIRIS; and (3) actual data from Landsat and
              MODIS. We observed virtually no reduction in the strength of
              relationships between \%N and reflectance when using coarser
              bandwidths from AVIRIS, but instead saw declines with increasing
              spatial resolution and loss of sensor fidelity. This suggests
              that past efforts to examine foliar \%N using broad-band sensors
              may have been limited as much by the latter two properties as by
              their coarser spectral bandwidths. We also found that regression
              models were driven primarily by reflectance over broad portions
              of the near infrared (NIR) region, with little contribution from
              the visible or mid infrared regions. These results suggest that

  abstract  = "1. Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and
               prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to
               express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities
               and interactions. 2. This study provides a working guide to
               boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting
               statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional
               techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted
               regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms:
               regression trees (models that relate a response to their
               predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive
               method for combining many simple models to give improved
               predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood
               as an additive regression model in which individual terms are
               simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3. Boosted
               regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based
               methods, handling different types of predictor variables and
               accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data
               transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex
               nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction
               effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT
               overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their
               relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are
               complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful
               ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior
               to most traditional modelling methods. 4. The unique features of
               BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We
               demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT
               through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel
               (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New
               Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate
               effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model
               using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to

               over large spatial extents. Over the last four decades, advances
               in remote sensing technology have enabled the classification of
               tree species from several sensor types. While studies using
               remote sensing data to classify and map tree species reach back
               several decades, a recent review on the status, potentials,
               challenges and outlooks in this realm is missing. Here, we
               search for major trends in remote sensing techniques for tree
               species classification and discuss the effectiveness of
               different sensors and algorithms based on a literature review.
               This review demonstrates that the number of studies focusing on
               tree species classification has increased constantly over the
               last four decades and promising local scale approaches have been
               presented for several sensor types. However, there are few
               examples for tree species classifications over large geographic
               extents, and bridging the gap between current approaches and
               tree species inventories over large geographic extents is still
               one of the biggest challenges of this research field.
               Furthermore, we found only few studies which systematically
               described and examined the traits that drive the observed
               variance in the remote sensing signal and thereby enable or
               hamper species classifications. Most studies followed
               data-driven approaches and pursued an optimization of
               classification accuracy, while a concrete hypothesis or a
               targeted application was missing in all but a few exceptional
               studies. We recommend that future research efforts focus
               stronger on the causal understanding of why tree species
               classification approaches work under certain conditions or --
               maybe even more important - why they do not work in other cases.
               This might require more complex field acquisitions than those
               typically used in the reviewed studies. At the same time, we
               recommend reducing the number of purely data-driven studies and
               algorithm-benchmarking studies as these studies are of limited
               value, especially if the experimental design is limited, e.g.
               the tree population is not representative and only a few sensors
               or acquisition settings are simultaneously investigated.",

               predict species from hyperspectral data at the pixel scale. Tree
               crowns are segmented from the lidar imagery such that
               crown-level information, such as maximum tree height, can then

  abstract = "Remote sensing of canopy chemistry could greatly advance the
              study and monitoring of functional processes and biological
              diversity in humid tropical forests. Imaging spectroscopy has
              contributed to canopy chemical remote sensing, but efforts to
              develop general, globally-applicable approaches have been limited
              by sparse and inconsistent field and laboratory data, and lacking
              analytical methods. We analyzed leaf hemispherical reflectance
              and transmittance spectra, along with a 21-chemical portfolio,
              taken from 6136 fully sunlit humid tropical forest canopies, and
              developed an up-scaling method using a combination of canopy
              radiative transfer, chemometric and high-frequency noise
              modeling. By integrating these steps, we found that the accuracy
              and precision of multi-chemical remote sensing of tropical forest
              canopies varies by leaf constituent and wavelength range. Under
              conditions of varying canopy structure and spectral noise,
              photosynthetic pigments, water, nitrogen, cellulose, lignin,
              phenols and leaf mass per area (LMA) are accurately estimated
              using visible-to-shortwave infrared spectroscopy (VSWIR;
              400--2500nm). Phosphorus and base cations are retrieved with
              lower yet significant accuracy. We also find that leaf chemical
              properties are estimated far more consistently, and with much
              higher precision and accuracy, using the VSWIR range rather than
              the more common and limited visible to near-infrared range
              (400--1050nm; VNIR). While VNIR spectroscopy proved accurate for
              predicting foliar LMA, photosynthetic pigments and water, VSWIR
              spectra provided accurate estimates for three times the number of
              canopy traits. These global results proved to be independent of
              site conditions, taxonomic composition and phylogenetic history,
              and thus they should be broadly applicable to multi-chemical
              mapping of humid tropical forest canopies. The approach developed
              and tested here paves the way for studies of canopy chemical
              properties in humid tropical forests using the next generation of
              airborne and space-based high-fidelity imaging spectrometers.",

               and lianas from high-resolution spectral data collected at the

              poorly understood, and airborne imaging spectroscopy could
              provide useful information at leaf and canopy scales. However,
              variation in canopy structure affects our ability to estimate
              foliar properties from airborne spectrometer data, yet these
              structural affects remain poorly quantified. Using leaf spectral
              (400--2500 nm) and chemical data collected from 162 Australian
              tropical forest species, along with partial least squares (PLS)
              analysis and canopy radiative transfer modeling, we determined
              the strength of the relationship between canopy reflectance and
              foliar properties under conditions of varying canopy structure.
              At the leaf level, chlorophylls, carotenoids and specific leaf
              area (SLA) were highly correlated with leaf spectral reflectance
              (r=0.90--0.91). Foliar nutrients and water were also well
              represented by the leaf spectra (r=0.79--0.85). When the leaf
              spectra were incorporated into the canopy radiative transfer
              simulations with an idealistic leaf area index (LAI)=5.0,
              correlations between canopy reflectance spectra and leaf
              properties increased in strength by 4--18\%. The effects of
              random LAI (=3.0--6.5) variation on the retrieval of leaf
              properties remained minimal, particularly for pigments and SLA
              (r=0.92--0.93). In contrast, correlations between leaf nitrogen
              (N) and canopy reflectance estimates decreased from r=0.87 at
              constant LAI=5 to r=0.65 with randomly varying LAI=3.0--6.5.
              Progressive increases in the structural variability among
              simulated tree crowns had relatively little effect on pigment,
              SLA and water predictions. However, N and phosphorus (P) were
              more sensitive to canopy structural variability. Our modeling
              results suggest that multiple leaf chemicals and SLA can be
              estimated from leaf and canopy reflectance spectroscopy, and that
              the high-LAI canopies found in tropical forests enhance the
              signal via multiple scattering. Finally, the two factors we found
              to most negatively impact leaf chemical predictions from canopy
              reflectance were variation in LAI and viewing geometry, which can
              be managed with new airborne technologies and analytical methods.",

  abstract = "Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that occurs mainly in
              the tropics and subtropics but has a high potential to spread to
              new areas. Dengue infections are climate sensitive, so it is
              important to better understand how changing climate factors
              affect the potential for geographic spread and future dengue
              epidemics. Vectorial capacity (VC) describes a vector's
              propensity to transmit dengue taking into account human, virus,
              and vector interactions. VC is highly temperature dependent, but
              most dengue models only take mean temperature values into
              account. Recent evidence shows that diurnal temperature range
              (DTR) plays an important role in influencing the behavior of the
              primary dengue vector Aedes aegypti. In this study, we used
              relative VC to estimate dengue epidemic potential (DEP) based on
              the temperature and DTR dependence of the parameters of A.
              aegypti. We found a strong temperature dependence of DEP; it
              peaked at a mean temperature of 29.3°C when DTR was 0°C and at
              20°C when DTR was 20°C. Increasing average temperatures up to
              29°C led to an increased DEP, but temperatures above 29°C reduced
              DEP. In tropical areas where the mean temperatures are close to
              29°C, a small DTR increased DEP while a large DTR reduced it. In
              cold to temperate or extremely hot climates where the mean
              temperatures are far from 29°C, increasing DTR was associated
              with increasing DEP. Incorporating these findings using
              historical and predicted temperature and DTR over a two hundred
              year period (1901-2099), we found an increasing trend of global
              DEP in temperate regions. Small increases in DEP were observed
              over the last 100 years and large increases are expected by the
              end of this century in temperate Northern Hemisphere regions
              using climate change projections. These findings illustrate the
              importance of including DTR when mapping DEP based on VC.",

              Significant predictions of monthly mosquito activity and
              distributions indicate that predicting spatiotemporal dynamics of
              disease vector species is feasible; significant coincidence with
              human cases of dengue indicate that these dynamics probably
              translate directly into transmission of dengue virus to humans.

              biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of
              the $\approx$550 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) of biomass distributed
              among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of
              life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants
              ($\approx$450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily
              terrestrial, whereas animals ($\approx$2 Gt C) are mainly marine,
              and bacteria ($\approx$70 Gt C) and archaea ($\approx$7 Gt C) are

              globally, but its burden is poorly quantified. We estimated
              dengue mortality, incidence, and burden for the Global Burden of
              Disease Study 2013. METHODS: We modelled mortality from vital
              registration, verbal autopsy, and surveillance data using the
              Cause of Death Ensemble Modelling tool. We modelled incidence
              from officially reported cases, and adjusted our raw estimates
              for under-reporting based on published estimates of expansion
              factors. In total, we had 1780 country-years of mortality data
              from 130 countries, 1636 country-years of dengue case reports
              from 76 countries, and expansion factor estimates for 14
              countries. FINDINGS: We estimated an average of 9221 dengue
              deaths per year between 1990 and 2013, increasing from a low of
              8277 (95\% uncertainty estimate 5353-10 649) in 1992, to a peak
              of 11 302 (6790-13 722) in 2010. This yielded a total of 576 900
              (330 000-701 200) years of life lost to premature mortality
              attributable to dengue in 2013. The incidence of dengue increased
              greatly between 1990 and 2013, with the number of cases more than
              doubling every decade, from 8·3 million (3·3 million-17·2
              million) apparent cases in 1990, to 58·4 million (23·6
              million-121·9 million) apparent cases in 2013. When accounting
              for disability from moderate and severe acute dengue, and
              post-dengue chronic fatigue, 566 000 (186 000-1 415 000) years
              lived with disability were attributable to dengue in 2013.
              Considering fatal and non-fatal outcomes together, dengue was
              responsible for 1·14 million (0·73 million-1·98 million)
              disability-adjusted life-years in 2013. INTERPRETATION: Although
              lower than other estimates, our results offer more evidence that
              the true symptomatic incidence of dengue probably falls within
              the commonly cited range of 50 million to 100 million cases per
              year. Our mortality estimates are lower than those presented
              elsewhere and should be considered in light of the totality of
              evidence suggesting that dengue mortality might, in fact, be
              substantially higher. FUNDING: Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.",

  abstract  = "Accurate modeling of geographic distributions of species is
               crucial to various applications in ecology and conservation. The
               best performing techniques often require some parameter tuning,
               which may be prohibitively time?consuming to do separately for
               each species, or unreliable for small or biased datasets.
               Additionally, even with the abundance of good quality data,
               users interested in the application of species models need not
               have the statistical knowledge required for detailed tuning. In
               such cases, it is desirable to use ?default settings?, tuned and
               validated on diverse datasets. Maxent is a recently introduced
               modeling technique, achieving high predictive accuracy and
               enjoying several additional attractive properties. The
               performance of Maxent is influenced by a moderate number of
               parameters. The first contribution of this paper is the
               empirical tuning of these parameters. Since many datasets lack
               information about species absence, we present a tuning method
               that uses presence?only data. We evaluate our method on
               independently collected high?quality presence?absence data. In
               addition to tuning, we introduce several concepts that improve
               the predictive accuracy and running time of Maxent. We introduce
               ?hinge features? that model more complex relationships in the
               training data; we describe a new logistic output format that
               gives an estimate of probability of presence; finally we explore
               ?background sampling? strategies that cope with sample selection
               bias and decrease model?building time. Our evaluation, based on
               a diverse dataset of 226 species from 6 regions, shows: 1)
               default settings tuned on presence?only data achieve performance
               which is almost as good as if they had been tuned on the
               evaluation data itself; 2) hinge features substantially improve
               model performance; 3) logistic output improves model
               calibration, so that large differences in output values
               correspond better to large differences in suitability; 4)
               ?target?group? background sampling can give much better
               predictive performance than random background sampling; 5)
               random background sampling results in a dramatic decrease in
               running time, with no decrease in model performance.",

              interstate highway system, which suggests further dispersal by

              shipments of used tires from countries with Ae. albopictus to be
              treated to prevent further importations. Given the extensive

              Americas was estimated to cost $2.1 billion per year on average

              Americas. The burden for dengue exceeds that from other viral
              illnesses, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) or rotavirus.

  abstract  = "Aim Niche-based distribution models are often used to predict
               the spread of invasive species. These models assume niche
               conservation during invasion, but invasive species can have
               different requirements from populations in their native range
               for many reasons, including niche evolution. I used distribution
               modelling to investigate niche conservatism for the Asian tiger
               mosquito (Aedes albopictus Skuse) during its invasion of three
               continents. I also used this approach to predict areas at risk
               of invasion from propagules originating from invasive
               populations. Location Models were created for Southeast Asia,
               North and South America, and Europe. Methods I used maximum
               entropy (Maxent) to create distribution models using occurrence
               data and 18 environmental datasets. One native model was created
               for Southeast Asia; this model was projected onto North America,
               South America and Europe. Three models were created
               independently for the non-native ranges and projected onto the
               native range. Niche overlap between native and non-native
               predictions was evaluated by comparing probability surfaces
               between models using real data and random models generated using
               a permutation approach. Results The native model failed to
               predict an entire region of occurrences in South America,
               approximately 20\% of occurrences in North America and nearly
               all Italian occurrences of A. albopictus. Non-native models
               poorly predict the native range, but predict additional areas at
               risk for invasion globally. Niche overlap metrics indicate that
               non-native distributions are more similar to the native niche
               than a random prediction, but they are not equivalent.
               Multivariate analyses support modelled differences in niche
               characteristics among continents, and reveal important variables
               explaining these differences. Main conclusions The niche of A.
               albopictus has shifted on invaded continents relative to its
               native range (Southeast Asia). Statistical comparisons reveal
               that the niche for introduced distributions is not equivalent to
               the native niche. Furthermore, reciprocal models highlight the
               importance of controlling bi-directional dispersal between
               native and non-native distributions.",

              native and introduced ranges are geographically independent of

               replaced forests, as shown by many local and regional studies.
               However, expansion varied regionally and also replaced other
               land covers. Further, it is important to distinguish between
               changes in cropland and pastureland as they produce food at
               different levels of efficiency and intensity. We used thirteen
               years (2001--2013) of MODerate Resolution Imaging
               Spectroradiometer satellite imagery to characterize cropland and
               pastureland expansion at multiple scales across Latin America.
               From 2001 to 2013, 17\% of new cropland and 57\% of new
               pastureland replaced forests throughout Latin America. Cropland
               expansion from 2001 to 2013 was less (44.27 Mha) than
               pastureland (96.9 Mha), but 44\% of the 2013 cropland total was
               new cropland, versus 27\% of the 2013 pastureland total,
               revealing higher regional expansion rates of row crop

               pastureland largely expanded at frontiers, such as central

               suggested, regional agriculture is strongly influenced by
               globalization. Indeed, we find an overall decrease in
               agricultural expansion after 2007, coinciding with the global
               economic slowdown. The results illustrate agricultural cropland
               and pastureland expansion across Latin America is largely
               segregated, and emphasize the importance of distinguishing

  abstract = "The mosquito Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera:
              Culicidae), originally indigenous to South-east Asia, islands of
              the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean, has spread during recent
              decades to Africa, the mid-east, Europe and the Americas (north
              and south) after extending its range eastwards across Pacific
              islands during the early 20th century. The majority of
              introductions are apparently due to transportation of dormant
              eggs in tyres. Among public health authorities in the newly
              infested countries and those threatened with the introduction,
              there has been much concern that Ae. albopictus would lead to
              serious outbreaks of arbovirus diseases (Ae. albopictus is a
              competent vector for at least 22 arboviruses), notably dengue
              (all four serotypes) more commonly transmitted by Aedes
              (Stegomyia) aegypti (L.). Results of many laboratory studies have
              shown that many arboviruses are readily transmitted by Ae.
              albopictus to laboratory animals and birds, and have frequently
              been isolated from wild-caught mosquitoes of this species,
              particularly in the Americas. As Ae. albopictus continues to
              spread, displacing Ae. aegypti in some areas, and is
              anthropophilic throughout its range, it is important to review
              the literature and attempt to predict whether the medical risks
              are as great as have been expressed in scientific journals and
              the popular press. Examination of the extensive literature
              indicates that Ae. albopictus probably serves as a maintenance
              vector of dengue in rural areas of dengue-endemic countries of
              South-east Asia and Pacific islands. Also Ae. albopictus
              transmits dog heartworm Dirofilaria immitis (Leidy) (Spirurida:
              Onchocercidae) in South-east Asia, south-eastern U.S.A. and both
              D. immitis and Dirofilaria repens (Raillet \& Henry) in Italy.
              Despite the frequent isolation of dengue viruses from wild-caught
              mosquitoes, there is no evidence that Ae. albopictus is an
              important urban vector of dengue, except in a limited number of
              countries where Ae. aegypti is absent, i.e. parts of China, the
              Seychelles, historically in Japan and most recently in Hawaii.
              Further research is needed on the dynamics of the interaction
              between Ae. albopictus and other Stegomyia species. Surveillance
              must also be maintained on the vectorial role of Ae. albopictus
              in countries endemic for dengue and other arboviruses (e.g.
              Chikungunya, EEE, Ross River, WNV, LaCrosse and other California
              group viruses), for which it would be competent and ecologically
              suited to serve as a bridge vector.",

              for most vector-borne pathogens. We built a mechanistic model for
              the thermal response of Ross River virus, an important
              mosquito-borne pathogen in Australia, Pacific Islands, and
              potentially at risk of emerging worldwide. Transmission peaks at
              moderate temperatures (26.4°C) and declines to zero at thermal
              limits (17.0 and 31.5°C). The model accurately predicts that
              transmission is year-round endemic in the tropics but seasonal in
              temperate areas, resulting in the nationwide seasonal peak in

              done principally by means of transport of eggs in used tyres via
              rapid air and sea transport. Egg positive used tyres, when

               control efforts have not stopped its rapid emergence and global

               of dengue occurrence worldwide, and use a formal modelling
               framework to map the global distribution of dengue risk. We then
               pair the resulting risk map with detailed longitudinal
               information from dengue cohort studies and population surfaces
               to infer the public health burden of dengue in 2010. We predict
               dengue to be ubiquitous throughout the tropics, with local
               spatial variations in risk influenced strongly by rainfall,
               temperature and the degree of urbanization. Using cartographic
               approaches, we estimate there to be 390 million (95\% credible
               interval 284-528) dengue infections per year, of which 96
               million (67-136) manifest apparently (any level of disease

               and adaptation present two fundamentally dissimilar approaches
               whose differences are now well documented. Forest ecosystems
               play an important role in both adaptation and mitigation and
               there is a need to explore the linkages between these two
               options in order to understand their trade-offs and synergies.
               In forests, potential trade-offs can be observed between global
               ecosystem services, such as the carbon sequestration relevant
               for mitigation, and the local ecosystem services that are
               relevant for adaptation. In addition, mitigation projects can
               facilitate or hinder the adaptation of local people to climate
               change, whereas adaptation projects can affect ecosystems and
               their potential to sequester carbon. Linkages between adaptation

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Aedes albopictus is a very invasive and aggressive
              insect vector that causes outbreaks of dengue fever, chikungunya
              disease, and yellow fever in many countries. Vector ecology and
              disease epidemiology are strongly affected by environmental
              changes. Urbanization is a worldwide trend and is one of the most
              ecologically modifying phenomena. The purpose of this study is to
              determine how environmental changes due to urbanization affect
              the ecology of Aedes albopictus. METHODS: Aquatic habitats and
              Aedes albopictus larval population surveys were conducted from
              May to November 2013 in three areas representing rural, suburban,
              and urban settings in Guangzhou, China. Ae. albopictus adults
              were collected monthly using BG-Sentinel traps. Ae. albopictus
              larva and adult life-table experiments were conducted with 20
              replicates in each of the three study areas. RESULTS: The urban
              area had the highest and the rural area had the lowest number of
              aquatic habitats that tested positive for Ae. albopictus larvae.
              Densities in the larval stages varied among the areas, but the
              urban area had almost two-fold higher densities in pupae and
              three-fold higher in adult populations compared with the suburban
              and rural areas. Larvae developed faster and the adult emergence
              rate was higher in the urban area than in suburban and rural
              areas. The survival time of adult mosquitoes was also longer in
              the urban area than it was in suburban and rural areas. Study
              regions, surface area, water depth, water clearance, surface
              type, and canopy coverage were important factors associated with
              the presence of Ae. albopictus larvae. CONCLUSIONS: Urbanization
              substantially increased the density, larval development rate, and
              adult survival time of Ae. albopictus, which in turn potentially
              increased the vector capacity, and therefore, disease
              transmissibility. Mosquito ecology and its correlation with
              dengue virus transmission should be compared in different

              abundance to sixteen land cover variables derived from 2010 NAIP
              multispectral data and 2008 LiDAR height data. Mosquitoes were
              trapped with 30-9 traps from May to October of 2010 and 2011.
              Variables were extracted for five buffer zones (10-50 m radii at
              10 m intervals) around trapping sites. Stepwise regression was
              performed to determine the best scale for observation and the
              influential land cover variables. The 30 m radius buffer was
              determined to be the best for observing the land cover-mosquito
              abundance relationship. Ae. aegypti presence was positively
              associated with structure and medium height trees and negatively

              processes such as development under warm conditions, increases
              processes under cool conditions, and reduces both the optimum and
              the critical maximum temperature. Generalizing these effects for
              a range of terrestrial insects reveals that prevailing daily

              has been of low productivity and unsustainable. The loss of
              biodiversity and continued deforestation will lead to high risks
              of irreversible change of its tropical forests. It has been
              established by modeling studies that the Amazon may have two

              deforestation exceeding 40\% of the forest area. If transgressed,
              large-scale ``savannization'' of mostly southern and eastern
              Amazon may take place. The region has warmed about 1 °C over the

              potential human exposure in climate change scenarios measured. We
              analyzed 125 sequences of a 317 bp fragment of the cyt b gene
              from seven A. albopictus populations across Mexico. The samples
              belong to 25 haplotypes with moderate population structuring

              predict cumulative monthly global transmission risk in current

              based on general circulation models (GCMs). Our results show that
              if mosquito range shifts track optimal temperature ranges for
              transmission (21.3-34.0°C for Ae. aegypti; 19.9-29.4°C for Ae.
              albopictus), we can expect poleward shifts in Aedes-borne virus
              distributions. However, the differing thermal niches of the two
              vectors produce different patterns of shifts under climate
              change. More severe climate change scenarios produce larger
              population exposures to transmission by Ae. aegypti, but not by
              Ae. albopictus in the most extreme cases. Climate-driven risk of
              transmission from both mosquitoes will increase substantially,
              even in the short term, for most of Europe. In contrast,
              significant reductions in climate suitability are expected for
              Ae. albopictus, most noticeably in southeast Asia and west
              Africa. Within the next century, nearly a billion people are
              threatened with new exposure to virus transmission by both Aedes
              spp. in the worst-case scenario. As major net losses in
              year-round transmission risk are predicted for Ae. albopictus, we
              project a global shift towards more seasonal risk across regions.
              Many other complicating factors (like mosquito range limits and
              viral evolution) exist, but overall our results indicate that
              while climate change will lead to increased net and new exposures
              to Aedes-borne viruses, the most extreme increases in Ae.

              monthly climate data for global land areas at a very high spatial

              (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation,
              vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target
              temporal range of 1970?2000, using data from between 9000 and
              60?000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated
              using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation,
              distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates:
              maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud
              cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation
              was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station
              density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for
              temperature variables 5?15\% (0.07?0.17 °C), particularly for
              areas with a low station density, although prediction error
              remained high in such regions for all climate variables.
              Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for
              the other variables, although their importance varied by region.
              In contrast to the common approach to use a single model

              effect of changing climate on distribution of dengue vectors in
              relation to epidemic risk areas in Tanzania. METHODS/FINDINGS: We
              used ecological niche models that incorporated presence-only
              infected Aedes aegypti data co-occurrence with dengue virus to
              estimate potential distribution of epidemic risk areas. Model
              input data on infected Ae. aegypti was collected during the May
              to June 2014 epidemic in Dar es Salaam. Bioclimatic predictors
              for current and future projections were also used as model
              inputs. Model predictions indicated that habitat suitability for
              infected Ae. aegypti co-occurrence with dengue virus in current
              scenarios is highly localized in the coastal areas, including Dar
              es Salaam, Pwani, Morogoro, Tanga and Zanzibar. Models indicate
              that areas of Kigoma, Ruvuma, Lindi, and those around Lake

  abstract = "The current outbreak of Zika virus poses a severe threat to human
              health. While the range of the virus has been cataloged growing
              slowly over the last 50 years, the recent explosive expansion in
              the Americas indicates that the full potential distribution of
              Zika remains uncertain. Moreover, many studies rely on its
              similarity to dengue fever, a phylogenetically closely related
              disease of unknown ecological comparability. Here we compile a
              comprehensive spatially-explicit occurrence dataset from Zika
              viral surveillance and serological surveys based in its native
              range, and construct ecological niche models to test basic
              hypotheses about its spread and potential establishment. The
              hypothesis that the outbreak of cases in Mexico and North America
              are anomalous and outside the native ecological niche of the
              disease, and may be linked to either genetic shifts between
              strains, or El Nino or similar climatic events, remains plausible
              at this time. Comparison of the Zika niche against the known
              distribution of dengue fever suggests that Zika is more
              constrained by the seasonality of precipitation and diurnal
              temperature fluctuations, likely confining autochthonous
              non-sexual transmission to the tropics without significant
              evolutionary change. Projecting the range of the diseases in
              conjunction with three major vector species (Aedes africanus, Ae.
              aegypti, and Ae. albopictus) that transmit the pathogens, under
              climate change, suggests that Zika has potential for northward
              expansion; but, based on current knowledge, our models indicate
              Zika is unlikely to fill the full range its vectors occupy, and
              public fear of a vector-borne Zika epidemic in the mainland
              United States is potentially informed by biased or limited
              scientific knowledge. With recent sexual transmission of the
              virus globally, we caution that our results only apply to the
              vector-borne transmission route of the pathogen, and while the
              threat of a mosquito-carried Zika pandemic may be overstated in
              the media, other transmission modes of the virus may emerge and
              facilitate naturalization worldwide.",

              Ministry with the aim of building vector distribution models to
              identify epidemiological hotspots. METHODS: Maxent software was
              used to predict the environmental suitability of the vector under
              current and 2050 climatic conditions. We built potential risk
              maps for current and future epidemiological scenarios in order to
              provide data for vector control planning. RESULTS: The results
              showed that the current epidemiological status is critical in the
              coastal region, with 80\% of the population in risk areas and
              30\% in epidemiological outbreak areas. Our results also suggest

              While there is evidence for widespread declines from population

              considered a poor vector of human pathogens, owing to its
              catholic feeding behavior. However, it was recently incriminated
              as a major vector in several Chikungunya epidemics, outside of

              behavior by Ae. albopictus females in Yaound{\'e}, Cameroon,
              Central Africa. Host preference was explored and the human-biting
              activity of females was monitored over 24 h to determine periods
              of maximum bite exposure. FINDINGS: Analysis of ingested blood in
              outdoor-resting females showed that Ae. albopictus preferentially
              fed on humans rather than on available domestic animals (95\% of
              the blood meals contained human blood). Our results further

  abstract  = "Summary 1 Spatial autocorrelation is an important source of bias
               in most spatial analyses. We explored the bias introduced by
               spatial autocorrelation on the explanatory and predictive power
               of species? distribution models, and make recommendations for
               dealing with the problem. 2 Analyses were based on the
               distribution of two species of freshwater turtle and two virtual
               species with simulated spatial structures within two equally
               sized areas located on the Iberian Peninsula. Sequential
               permutations of environmental variables were used to generate
               predictor variables that retained the spatial structure of the
               original variables. Univariate models of species? distributions
               using generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive
               models (GAM) and classification tree analysis (CTA) were fitted
               for each variable permutation. Variation of accuracy measures
               with spatial autocorrelation of the original predictor
               variables, as measured by Moran's I, was analysed and compared
               between models. The effects of systematic subsampling of the
               data set and the inclusion of a contagion term to deal with
               spatial autocorrelation in models were assessed with projections
               made with GLM, as it was with this method that estimates of
               significance based on randomizations were obtained. 3 Spatial
               autocorrelation was shown to represent a serious problem for
               niche?based species? distribution models. Significance values
               were found to be inflated up to 90?fold. 4 In general, GAM and
               CTA performed better than GLM, although all three methods were
               vulnerable to the effects of spatial autocorrelation. 5 The
               procedures utilized to reduce the effects of spatial
               autocorrelation had varying degrees of success. Subsampling was
               partially effective in avoiding the inflation effect, whereas
               the inclusion of a contagion term fully eliminated or even
               overcompensated for this effect. Direct estimation of
               probability using variable simulations was effective, yet seemed
               to show some residual spatial autocorrelation effects. 6
               Synthesis and applications. Given the expected inflation in the
               estimates of significance when analysing spatially
               autocorrelated variables, these need to be adjusted. The
               reliability and value of niche?based distribution models for

              remains highly uncertain. Challenges in diagnosis and diagnostic
              methods as well as highly variable national health systems mean
              no single data source can reliably estimate the distribution of
              this disease. As such, there is a lack of agreement on national
              dengue status among international health organisations. Here we
              bring together all available information on dengue occurrence
              using a novel approach to produce an evidence consensus map of
              the disease range that highlights nations with an uncertain
              dengue status. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A baseline methodology
              was used to assess a range of evidence for each country. In
              regions where dengue status was uncertain, additional evidence
              types were included to either clarify dengue status or confirm
              that it is unknown at this time. An algorithm was developed that
              assesses evidence quality and consistency, giving each country an
              evidence consensus score. Using this approach, we were able to
              generate a contemporary global map of national-level dengue
              status that assigns a relative measure of certainty and
              identifies gaps in the available evidence. CONCLUSION: The map

              good evidence of dengue occurrence, including 36 countries that
              have previously been classified as dengue-free by the World

               understood under constant temperature conditions, but less so
               under more natural, fluctuating conditions. A fluctuating
               temperature profile around a mean of 26°C can alter Aedes

               life-history traits, however, the effect of fluctuations on
               mosquitoes at critical thermal limits is unknown.
               METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the effects of
               large and small daily temperature fluctuations at low (16°C) and
               high (35-37°C) mean temperatures, after we identified these
               temperatures as being thresholds for immature development and/or
               adult reproduction under constant temperature conditions. We
               found that temperature effects on larval development time,
               larval survival and adult reproduction depend on the combination
               of mean temperature and magnitude of fluctuations. Importantly,
               observed degree-day estimates for mosquito development under
               fluctuating temperature profiles depart significantly (around
               10-20\%) from that predicted by constant temperatures of the
               same mean. At low mean temperatures, fluctuations reduce the
               thermal energy required to reach pupation relative to constant
               temperature, whereas at high mean temperatures additional
               thermal energy is required to complete development. A
               stage-structured model based on these empirical data predicts
               that fluctuations can significantly affect the intrinsic growth
               rate of mosquito populations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our
               results indicate that by using constant temperatures, one could
               under- or over-estimate values for numerous life-history traits
               compared to more natural field conditions dependent upon the
               mean temperature. This complexity may in turn reduce the

              expansion over the past hundred years. Understanding what factors
              limit the distribution of transmission can be used to predict
              current and future limits to further dengue expansion. While not
              the only factor, temperature plays an important role in defining
              these limits. Previous attempts to analyse the effect of
              temperature on the geographic distribution of dengue have not
              considered its dynamic intra-annual and diurnal change and its
              cumulative effects on mosquito and virus populations. METHODS:
              Here we expand an existing modelling framework with new
              temperature-based relationships to model an index proportional to
              the basic reproductive number of the dengue virus. This model
              framework is combined with high spatial and temporal resolution
              global temperature data to model the effects of temperature on
              Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus persistence and competence for
              dengue virus transmission. RESULTS: Our model predicted areas
              where temperature is not expected to permit transmission and/or
              Aedes persistence throughout the year. By reanalysing existing
              experimental data our analysis indicates that Ae. albopictus,
              often considered a minor vector of dengue, has comparable rates
              of virus dissemination to its primary vector, Ae. aegypti, and
              when the longer lifespan of Ae. albopictus is considered its
              competence for dengue virus transmission far exceeds that of Ae.

              effects of temperature and other contributing factors on the

              albopictus has a greater capacity for dengue transmission than
              Ae. aegypti is contrary to current explanations for the
              comparative rarity of dengue transmission in established Ae.

               responses of mosquito and parasite life-history traits to
               temperature, predicting optimal transmission at 31 °C. These
               models are at odds with field observations of transmission
               dating back nearly a century. We build a model with more
               realistic ecological assumptions about the thermal physiology of
               insects. Our model, which includes empirically derived nonlinear
               thermal responses, predicts optimal malaria transmission at 25
               °C (6 °C lower than previous models). Moreover, the model
               predicts that transmission decreases dramatically at
               temperatures > 28 °C, altering predictions about how climate
               change will affect malaria. A large data set on malaria
               transmission risk in Africa validates both the 25 °C optimum and
               the decline above 28 °C. Using these more accurate nonlinear
               thermal-response models will aid in understanding the effects of
               current and future temperature regimes on disease transmission.",

              remain similar over time [niche conservatism (NC)] has many

              different mosquito species - including globally important
              diseases like malaria, dengue, and Zika - synthesised from
              previously published studies. Transmission varied strongly and
              unimodally with temperature, peaking at 23-29ºC and declining to
              zero below 9-23ºC and above 32-38ºC. Different traits restricted

               1000 published applications since 2006. Its popularity is likely
               for two reasons: 1) MaxEnt typically outperforms other methods
               based on predictive accuracy and 2) the software is particularly
               easy to use. MaxEnt users must make a number of decisions about

               variety of settings in the software package to build models from
               these data. The underlying basis for making these decisions is

  abstract = "The availability of detailed environmental data, together with
              inexpensive and powerful computers, has fueled a rapid increase
              in predictive modeling of species environmental requirements and
              geographic distributions. For some species, detailed
              presence/absence occurrence data are available, allowing the use
              of a variety of standard statistical techniques. However, absence
              data are not available for most species. In this paper, we
              introduce the use of the maximum entropy method (Maxent) for
              modeling species geographic distributions with presence-only
              data. Maxent is a general-purpose machine learning method with a
              simple and precise mathematical formulation, and it has a number
              of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution
              modeling. In order to investigate the efficacy of the method,
              here we perform a continental-scale case study using two
              Neotropical mammals: a lowland species of sloth, Bradypus
              variegatus, and a small montane murid rodent, Microryzomys
              minutus. We compared Maxent predictions with those of a commonly
              used presence-only modeling method, the Genetic Algorithm for
              Rule-Set Prediction (GARP). We made predictions on 10 random
              subsets of the occurrence records for both species, and then used
              the remaining localities for testing. Both algorithms provided
              reasonable estimates of the species' range, far superior to the
              shaded outline maps available in field guides. All models were
              significantly better than random in both binomial tests of
              omission and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.
              The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was almost always higher for
              Maxent, indicating better discrimination of suitable versus
              unsuitable areas for the species. The Maxent modeling approach
              can be used in its present form for many applications with
              presence-only datasets, and merits further research and
              development.",

              Across all three viruses, models and human case data both show
              that transmission occurs between 18-34°C with maximal
              transmission occurring in a range from 26-29°C. Controlling for

              understanding the consequences becomes increasingly important.
              Species distribution models (SDMs) based on current ecological
              niche constraints are used to project future species
              distributions. These models contain assumptions that add to the
              uncertainty in model projections stemming from the structure of
              the models, the algorithms used to translate niche associations
              into distributional probabilities, the quality and quantity of
              data, and mismatches between the scales of modeling and data. We
              illustrate the application of SDMs using two climate models and
              two distributional algorithms, together with information on
              distributional shifts in vegetation types, to project fine-scale
              future distributions of 60 California landbird species. Most
              species are projected to decrease in distribution by 2070.
              Changes in total species richness vary over the state, with large
              losses of species in some ``hotspots'' of vulnerability.
              Differences in distributional shifts among species will change
              species co-occurrences, creating spatial variation in
              similarities between current and future assemblages. We use these
              analyses to consider how assumptions can be addressed and
              uncertainties reduced. SDMs can provide a useful way to
              incorporate future conditions into conservation and management
              practices and decisions, but the uncertainties of model
              projections must be balanced with the risks of taking the wrong
              actions or the costs of inaction. Doing this will require that
              the sources and magnitudes of uncertainty are documented, and
              that conservationists and resource managers be willing to act

               scales, although it is shown to have precipitation
               rate?dependent low bias due to lack of sensitivity to low

              considerably in dengue endemic areas. Understanding how
              interactions between these factors influence the risk of
              transmission could improve the effectiveness of the allocation of
              vector control resources. To evaluate the combined impacts of
              variation in A. aegypti production and human density we
              integrated field data with simulation modeling.
              METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using data from seven censuses of
              A. aegypti pupae (2007-2009) and from demographic surveys, we
              developed an agent-based transmission model of the dengue
              transmission cycle across houses in 16 dengue-endemic urban
              'patches' (1-3 city blocks each) of Armenia, Colombia. Our field
              data showed that 92\% of pupae concentrated in only 5\% of
              houses, defined as super-producers. Average secondary infections
              (R(0)) depended on infrequent, but highly explosive transmission
              events. These super-spreading events occurred almost exclusively
              when the introduced infectious person infected mosquitoes that
              were produced in super-productive containers. Increased human
              density favored R(0), and when the likelihood of human
              introduction of virus was incorporated into risk, a strong
              interaction arose between vector production and human density.
              Simulated intervention of super-productive containers was
              substantially more effective in reducing dengue risk at higher
              human densities. SIGNIFICANCE/CONCLUSIONS: These results show
              significant interactions between human population density and the
              natural regulatory pattern of A. aegypti in the dynamics of
              dengue transmission. The large epidemiological significance of
              super-productive containers suggests that they have the potential
              to influence dengue viral adaptation to mosquitoes. Human
              population density plays a major role in dengue transmission, due
              to its potential impact on human-A. aegypti contact, both within
              a person's home and when visiting others. The large variation in
              population density within typical dengue endemic cities suggests
              that it should be a major consideration in dengue control policy.",

  abstract = "ABSTRACT Much biodiversity data is collected worldwide, but it
              remains challenging to assemble the scattered knowledge for
              assessing biodiversity status and trends. The concept of
              Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) was introduced to
              structure biodiversity monitoring globally, and to harmonize and
              standardize biodiversity data from disparate sources to capture a
              minimum set of critical variables required to study, report and
              manage biodiversity change. Here, we assess the challenges of a
              ?Big Data? approach to building global EBV data products across
              taxa and spatiotemporal scales, focusing on species distribution
              and abundance. The majority of currently available data on
              species distributions derives from incidentally reported
              observations or from surveys where presence-only or
              presence?absence data are sampled repeatedly with standardized
              protocols. Most abundance data come from opportunistic population
              counts or from population time series using standardized
              protocols (e.g. repeated surveys of the same population from
              single or multiple sites). Enormous complexity exists in
              integrating these heterogeneous, multi-source data sets across
              space, time, taxa and different sampling methods. Integration of
              such data into global EBV data products requires correcting
              biases introduced by imperfect detection and varying sampling
              effort, dealing with different spatial resolution and extents,
              harmonizing measurement units from different data sources or
              sampling methods, applying statistical tools and models for
              spatial inter- or extrapolation, and quantifying sources of
              uncertainty and errors in data and models. To support the
              development of EBVs by the Group on Earth Observations
              Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON), we identify 11 key
              workflow steps that will operationalize the process of building
              EBV data products within and across research infrastructures
              worldwide. These workflow steps take multiple sequential
              activities into account, including identification and aggregation
              of various raw data sources, data quality control, taxonomic name
              matching and statistical modelling of integrated data. We
              illustrate these steps with concrete examples from existing
              citizen science and professional monitoring projects, including
              eBird, the Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring network,
              the Living Planet Index and the Baltic Sea zooplankton
              monitoring. The identified workflow steps are applicable to both
              terrestrial and aquatic systems and a broad range of spatial,
              temporal and taxonomic scales. They depend on clear, findable and
              accessible metadata, and we provide an overview of current data
              and metadata standards. Several challenges remain to be solved
              for building global EBV data products: (i) developing tools and
              models for combining heterogeneous, multi-source data sets and
              filling data gaps in geographic, temporal and taxonomic coverage,
              (ii) integrating emerging methods and technologies for data
              collection such as citizen science, sensor networks, DNA-based
              techniques and satellite remote sensing, (iii) solving major
              technical issues related to data product structure, data storage,
              execution of workflows and the production process/cycle as well
              as approaching technical interoperability among research

  abstract  = "Human activities over the last three centuries have
               significantly transformed the Earth's environment, primarily
               through the conversion of natural ecosystems to agriculture.
               This study presents a simple approach to derive geographically
               explicit changes in global croplands from 1700 to 1992. By
               calibrating a remotely sensed land cover classification data set
               against cropland inventory data, we derived a global
               representation of permanent croplands in 1992, at 5 min spatial
               resolution [Ramankutty and Foley, 1998]. To reconstruct
               historical croplands, we first compile an extensive database of
               historical cropland inventory data, at the national and
               subnational level, from a variety of sources. Then we use our
               1992 cropland data within a simple land cover change model,
               along with the historical inventory data, to reconstruct global
               5 min resolution data on permanent cropland areas from 1992 back
               to 1700. The reconstructed changes in historical croplands are
               consistent with the history of human settlement and patterns of
               economic development. By overlaying our historical cropland data
               set over a newly derived potential vegetation data set, we
               analyze our results in terms of the extent to which different
               natural vegetation types have been converted for agriculture. We
               further examine the extent to which croplands have been
               abandoned in different parts of the world. Our data sets could
               be used within global climate models and global ecosystem models
               to understand the impacts of land cover change on climate and on
               the cycling of carbon and water. Such an analysis is a crucial
               aid to sharpen our thinking about a sustainable future.",

              2.24 million km2 (+7.1\% relative to the 1982 level). This

  author    = "Hubbell, Stephen P",
  abstract  = "Despite its supreme importance and the threat of its global
               crash, biodiversity remains poorly understood both empirically
               and theoretically. This ambitious book presents a new, general
               neutral theory to explain the origin, maintenance, and loss of
               biodiversity in a biogeographic context. Until now biogeography
               (the study of the geographic distribution of species) and
               biodiversity (the study of species richness and relative species
               abundance) have had largely disjunct intellectual histories. In
               this book, Stephen Hubbell develops a formal mathematical theory
               that unifies these two fields. When a speciation process is
               incorporated into Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson's now
               classical theory of island biogeography, the generalized theory
               predicts the existence of a universal, dimensionless
               biodiversity number. In the theory, this fundamental
               biodiversity number, together with the migration or dispersal
               rate, completely determines the steady-state distribution of
               species richness and relative species abundance on local to
               large geographic spatial scales and short-term to evolutionary
               time scales. Although neutral, Hubbell's theory is nevertheless
               able to generate many nonobvious, testable, and remarkably
               accurate quantitative predictions about biodiversity and
               biogeography. In many ways Hubbell's theory is the ecological
               analog to the neutral theory of genetic drift in genetics. The
               unified neutral theory of biogeography and biodiversity should
               stimulate research in new theoretical and empirical directions
               by ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and biogeographers.",

               regularization strategies are needed to mitigate the drawback of
               ill-posedness. We systematically evaluated various

               and leaf area index (LAI) retrievals over agricultural lands,
               including the role of (1) cost functions (CFs); (2) added noise;
               and (3) multiple solutions in LUT-based inversion. Three
               families of CFs were compared: information measures, M-estimates
               and minimum contrast methods. We have only selected CFs without
               additional parameters to be tuned, and thus they can be
               immediately implemented in processing chains. The coupled
               leaf/canopy model PROSAIL was inverted against simulated
               Sentinel-2 imagery at 20 m spatial resolution (8 bands) and
               validated against ﬁeld data from the ESA-led SPARC (Barrax,

              series has improved greatly over the past decade, with many new
              algorithms taking advantage of the high-quality, cost free data
              in the archive. Much of the innovation has been focused on use of
              sophisticated workflows that consist of a logical sequence of
              processes and rules, multiple statistical functions, and
              parameter sets that must be calibrated to accurately classify
              disturbance. For many algorithms, calibration has been local to
              areas of interest and the algorithm's classification performance
              has been good under those circumstances. When applied elsewhere,
              however, algorithm performance has suffered. An alternative
              strategy for calibration may be to use the locally tested
              parameter values in conjunction with a statistical approach
              (e.g., Random Forests; RF) to align algorithm classification with
              a reference disturbance dataset, a process we call secondary
              classification. We tested that strategy here using RF with
              LandTrendr, an algorithm that runs on one spectral band or index.
              Disturbance detection using secondary classification was spectral
              band- or index-dependent, with each spectral dimension providing
              some unique detections and different error rates. Using secondary
              classification, we tested whether an integrated multispectral
              LandTrendr ensemble, with various combinations of the six basic
              Landsat reflectance bands and seven common spectral indices,
              improves algorithm performance. Results indicated a substantial
              reduction in errors relative to secondary classification based on
              single bands/indices, revealing the importance of a multispectral
              approach to forest disturbance detection. To explain the
              importance of specific bands and spectral indices in the
              multispectral ensemble, we developed a disturbance
              signal-to-noise metric that clearly highlighted the value of
              shortwave-infrared reflectance, especially when paired with
              near-infrared reflectance.",

  abstract = "Assessing wildfire risk presents several challenges due to
              uncertainty in fuel flammability and ignition potential. Live
              fuel moisture content (LFMC) - the mass of water per unit dry
              biomass in vegetation - exerts a direct control on fuel
              ignitability, fuel availability and fire spread, and is thus an
              important parameter in assessing wildfire risk. Current estimates
              of LFMC from optical remote sensing or meteorological indices are
              insufficient to accurately map LFMC at landscape scale. In this
              study, we present a physics-assisted recurrent neural network
              model for mapping LFMC every 15 days at 250 m resolution over the
              western US using microwave backscatter (from Sentinel-1) and
              optical reflectance (from Landsat-8). The model was
              physics-assisted by adding handcrafted inputs representing
              radiative transfer processes and related parameters. Field data
              from the National Fuel Moisture Database was used to train the
              deep learning model. The model had a satisfactory overall
              predictability of R2 = 0.63, RMSE = 25.0\% and bias = 1.9\% when
              cross-validated at 125 sites. The model was substantially better
              at predicting site-means (R2 = 0.71 and RMSE = 14.3\%) as
              compared to site-anomalies (R2 = 0.55 and RMSE = 21.3\%). Of the
              6 land cover types tested, the model was most accurate in
              predicting LFMC in shrublands (R2 = 0.69), while closed broadleaf
              deciduous sites had the least accuracy (R2 = 0.49). Incorporating
              microwave backscatter as a model input significantly enhanced
              performance (R2 increasing from 0.44 to 0.63, and RMSE decreasing
              from 31.8\% to 25.0\%). Microwave backscatter therefore presents
              a complementary source of information to optical remote sensing
              metrics for LFMC mapping. The high resolution dynamic LFMC maps
              presented here may assist in improved wildfire risk

               information for water management in China after the 1998 Great
               Flood in the Yangtze River basin. This devastating flood is now
               believed to have been caused mainly by the 1997--98 El Ni{\~n}o
               event. Although the short-term climate forecasts and weather
               forecasts are considered to be useful in planning for flood
               prevention activities and for making key decisions during
               combating floods, the gap between the meteorological services
               (producers of climate forecasts) and water management agencies
               (users of climate forecasts) has grown in terms of credibility
               given to climate forecasting: weather services put more efforts
               on improving the technology for increasing forecast accuracy,
               whereas water managers put their efforts and investment into
               upstream ecological restoration and flood control systems. By
               reviewing the published and `gray' (unpublished) literature, we
               found that assessments of the 1998 Great Flood in the Yangtze

               resources agencies to recognize the weaknesses of the existing

               expanding at an estimated rate of 1560 $\{\rm km\}^\{2\}\ \{\rm

               techniques aim at halting desert encroachment and reconverting
               desertified land to productive uses. Techniques include the use
               of windbreaks, irrigating with silt-laden river water, dune

               land enclosure, redistribution of material from palaeosols and

               natural resource analysts without adequate definition. In this
               paper we develop a concept of access and examine a broad set of
               factors that differentiate access from property. We define
               access as ``the ability to derive benefits from things,''
               broadening from property's classical definition as ``the right
               to benefit from things.'' Access, following this definition, is
               more akin to ``a bundle of powers'' than to property's notion of
               a ``bundle of rights.'' This formulation includes a wider range
               of social relationships that constrain or enable benefits from
               resource use than property relations alone. Using this framing,
               we suggest a method of access analysis for identifying the
               constellations of means, relations, and processes that enable
               various actors to derive benefits from resources. Our intent is
               to enable scholars, planners, and policy makers to empirically
               ``map'' dynamic processes and relationships of access.",

               different forms and character as compared to processes that
               occur in other regions of the world, especially Africa. It puts
               into question some of the assumptions in the emerging literature
               on land grabbing, suggesting these are too food-centered/too
               food crisis-centered, too land-centred, too centred on new
               global food regime players ? China, South Korea, Gulf States and

               through which land grabbing in Latin American and the Caribbean
               has been carried out: food security initiatives, energy/fuel
               security ventures, other climate change mitigation strategies,
               and recent demands for resources from newer hubs of global
               capital. The hallmark of land grabbing in the region is its
               intra-regional character: the key investors are (Trans-)Latin
               American companies, often in alliance with international capital
               and the central state. Initial evidence suggests that recent
               land investments have consolidated the earlier trend away from

               Words such as ?exclusion?, ?alienation?, ?expropriation?,
               ?dispossession?, and ?violence? describe processes that animate
               land histories and those of resources, property rights, and
               territories created, extracted, produced, or protected on land.
               Primitive and on-going forms of accumulation, frontiers,
               enclosures, territories, grabs, and racializations have all been
               associated with mechanisms for land control. Agrarian
               environments have been transformed by processes of
               de-agrarianization, protected area establishment, urbanization,
               migration, land reform, resettlement, and re-peasantization.
               Even the classic agrarian question of how agriculture is
               influenced by capitalism has been reformulated multiple times at
               transformative conjunctures in the historical trajectories of
               these processes, reviving and producing new debates around the
               importance of land control. The authors in this collection focus
               primarily on new frontiers of land control and their active
               creation. These frontiers are sites where authorities,
               sovereignties, rights, and hegemonies of the recent past have
               been challenged by new enclosures, property regimes, and
               territorializations, producing new ?urban-agrarian-natured?
               environments, comprised of new labor and production processes;
               new actors, subjects, and networks connecting them; and new
               legal and violent means of challenging previous land controls.
               Some cases augment analytic tools that had seemed to have
               timeless applicability with new frameworks, concepts, and
               theoretical tools. What difference does land control make? These
               contributions to the debates demonstrate that the answers have
               been shaped by conflicts, contexts, histories, and agency, as

  abstract = "ABSTRACT Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic increase
              in large-scale land deals, often from public lands to the hands
              of foreign or domestic investors. Popularly referred to as a
              ?global land grab?, new land acquisitions are drawing upon,
              restructuring and challenging the nature of both governance and
              government. In the Introduction to this special issue, we argue
              for an analysis of land deals that draws upon the insights of
              political ecology, cultural politics and agrarian studies to
              illuminate the micro-processes of transaction and expropriation
              as well as the broader structural forces at play. We argue that
              ?the state? is often invoked as a key player in land grabbing but
              states never operate with one voice; rather we need to unbundle
              the state, to see government and governance as processes, people
              and relationships. To develop this approach, we focus on
              territory, sovereignty, authority and subjects not as static
              objects but as relationships produced in and through place,
              property, power and production. Understanding the dynamic nature
              of these relationships is critical to understanding the highly
              variable form and content of large-scale land deals in different
              settings around the world. The papers in this special issue help
              to develop this perspective and this Introduction highlights

  abstract  = "Payments for environmental services (PES) have attracted
               increasing interest as a mechanism to translate external,
               non-market values of the environment into real financial
               incentives for local actors to provide environmental services
               (ES). In this introductory paper, we set the stage for the rest
               of this Special Issue of Ecological Economics by reviewing the
               main issues arising in PES design and implementation and
               discussing these in the light of environmental economics. We
               start with a discussion of PES definition and scope. We proceed
               to review some of the principal dimensions and design
               characteristics of PES programs and then analyze how PES
               compares to alternative policy instruments. Finally, we examine
               in detail two important aspects of PES programs: their
               effectiveness and their distributional implications. PES is not
               a silver bullet that can be used to address any environmental
               problem, but a tool tailored to address a specific set of
               problems: those in which ecosystems are mismanaged because many
               of their benefits are externalities from the perspective of
               ecosystem managers. PES is based on the beneficiary-pays rather
               than the polluter-pays principle, and as such is attractive in
               settings where ES providers are poor, marginalized landholders
               or powerful groups of actors. An important distinction within
               PES is between user-financed PES in which the buyers are the
               users of the ES, and government-financed PES in which the buyers
               are others (typically the government) acting on behalf of ES
               users. In practice, PES programs differ in the type and scale of
               ES demand, the payment source, the type of activity paid for,
               the performance measure used, as well as the payment mode and
               amount. The effectiveness and efficiency of PES depends
               crucially on program design.",

              Biological Diversity and United Nations Sustainable Development
              Goals, but success to date has been very limited. A critical
              determinant of success in achieving these goals is the financing
              that is committed to maintaining biodiversity; however, financing
              decisions are hindered by considerable uncertainty over the
              likely impact of any conservation investment. For greater
              effectiveness, we need an evidence-based model that shows how
              conservation spending quantitatively reduces the rate of
              biodiversity loss. Here we demonstrate such a model, and
              empirically quantify how conservation investment reduced
              biodiversity loss in 109 countries (signatories to the Convention
              on Biological Diversity and Sustainable Development Goals), by a
              median average of 29\% per country between 1996 and 2008. We also
              show that biodiversity changes in signatory countries can be
              predicted with high accuracy, using a dual model that balances
              the effects of conservation investment against those of economic,
              agricultural and population growth (human development pressures).
              Decision-makers can use this model to forecast the improvement
              that any proposed biodiversity budget would achieve under various
              scenarios of human development pressure, and then compare these
              forecasts to any chosen policy target. We find that the impact of
              spending decreases as human development pressures grow, which
              implies that funding may need to increase over time. The model
              offers a flexible tool for balancing the Sustainable Development
              Goals of human development and maintaining biodiversity, by
              predicting the dynamic changes in conservation finance that will
              be needed as human development proceeds.",

              was ratified in 1992, 55\% have since experienced human pressure
              increases. These increases were lowest in large, strict protected
